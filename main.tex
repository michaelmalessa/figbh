\chapter{Preface}

The Free Introductory Grammar of Biblical Hebrew is intended to enable students to read the Hebrew Bible with the help of a lexicon. Verbal morphology is introduced at a very early stage because of its importance in the grammar of Biblical Hebrew and the biblical texts themselves. The vocabulary includes almost all words that occur fifty times or more in the Hebrew Bible and a number of less frequent but important words. All exercises and examples are taken from the Hebrew Bible.

Special thanks go to my students at the Biblical Seminary of the Philippines in Valenzuela City and the Asian Theological Seminary in Quezon City for letting me try this introductory grammar on them in the academic year 2024--25.

With the plethora of Hebrew introductory grammars on the market the natural question is why another one is presented to the public. There are two reasons for this.

First, this grammar was written with the intention of making a Hebrew grammar for beginners available at no costs and without a restrictive license. Therefore, it is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License. For more information see the copyright page.

Second, this grammar introduces the most frequent verbal forms including weak forms at a very early stage and uses only authentic Biblical Hebrew for the examples and the exercises. In this respect it follows the model of Ernst Jenni's \textit{Lehrbuch der hebräischen Sprache des Alten Testaments} (4th ed.; Basel: Schwabe, 2009). This approach makes it possible to present authentic Hebrew sentences already in Chapter 3 and to avoid the pitfalls of self-composed Hebrew.

This book was typeset in \LaTeX \space because of the capabilities of \LaTeX \space and the fact that it is open source software and platform independent. The use of open source software is a prerequisite for a truly free work. This applies to fonts, as well. As a consequence, only fonts under a free license are used.

More information about \LaTeX \space is available on Wikipedia \space \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX} and the website of the \TeX \space Users Group \url{https://www.tug.org/}. Information about the installation of \LaTeX \space can be found here: \url{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}.

\section{The Hebrew Alphabet}
	\noindent The Hebrew alphabet consists of 22 letters, originally representing only consonants. Hebrew is written from right to left. One letter, the letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ש}, represents two distinct consonants.

\noindent \textbf{Additional Information}

\noindent The Hebrew term for alphabet is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א״ב} which is pronounced \textit{ʾālæp̄-bēt}.

The pronunciation of the consonants is indicated by English words beginning with a corresponding consonant except for the letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח}. At times, the English word gives the pronunciation of the Hebrew sound only by approximation.

The second letter after the comma (when read from right to left) in the first column is the shape of the letter when it occurs at the end of a word. These letters with a distinct shape at the end of a word are called final letters or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּמְנַפֵּץ} \textit{kamnappēṣ} letters.

The \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} is pronounced with the tip of the tongue (as \textit{r} in Tagalog).

The letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ש} originally represented two distinct consonants, i.e., /ś/ and /š/. Traditionally, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ש} representing /ś/ is pronounced as a voiceless sibilant [s]. Its original pronunciation was probably that of a lateral-fricative sibilant [ɬ], i.e., a sibilant [s] combined with an [l]-element. The graphical distinction between /ś/ and /š/ was only introduced by the Masoretes by placing a diacritic point either on the right or the left upper corner of the letter. The result were two distinct letters (or graphemes) with /ś/ being represented by \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂ} and /š/ by \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁ}. Before the introduction of the diacritic points only the correct understanding of a text made it possible for the reader to distinguish between the two consonants. The letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁ} is much more frequent in Hebrew than the letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂ}.

It is important to distinguish letters that look alike and consonants that sound alike or identical in the applied reading tradition.

\section{\textit{Bəgadkəfat} Letters}

The letters \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פ} have a double pronunciation in the table above. When they are preceded by a consonant or when they are doubled (geminated), they are pronounced as plosives whereas they are pronounced as fricatives when they are preceded by a vocalic element, either vowel or a reduced vowel.

\medskip

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|}
		\hline
		& plosive & fricative \\
		\hline
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ב} & \textit{b} & \textit{ḇ/v} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ך} ,\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כ} & \textit{k} & \textit{ḵ} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ף} ,\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פ} & \textit{p} & \textit{p̄/f} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

\noindent Final \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ף} is always pronounced as a fricative. Final \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ך} is mostly pronounced as a fricative but it can represent a plosive sound, too.

In Masoretic Hebrew three more consonants had a double pronunciation, i.e., as plosives after a consonant or when doubled or as fricatives after a vowel.

\medskip

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|r|c|cl|}
		\hline
		& plosive & fricative & \\
		\hline
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ג} & \textit{g} & \textit{ḡ} & like \foreignlanguage{greek}{γ} in Mod. Gr. \foreignlanguage{greek}{γάλα}\\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ד} & \textit{d} & \textit{ḏ} & like \textit{th} in Engl. \textit{this} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} & \textit{t} & \textit{ṯ} & like \textit{th} in Engl. \textit{thing} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

As a group, these six letters are called \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּגַדְכְּפַת} \textit{bəgadkəfat} letters (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אותיות בג״ד כפ״ת}).

In Modern Hebrew, only the letters \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פ} have a double pronunciation. This distinction is followed for the pronunciation of these letters in Biblical Hebrew. The double pronunciation of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ג}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ד} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} in Masoretic Hebrew is usually ignored.

In pointed (or vocalized) Hebrew (see the next chapter), a dot called \textit{dageš} is added to \textit{bəgadkəfat} letters to distinguish the plosive pronunciation (with \textit{dageš}) from the fricative pronunciation (without \textit{dageš}).

\section{Gutturals}
The four consonants \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א},  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה},  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} represent guttural sounds which means that they are articulated in the throat. (The term \textit{guttural} is derived from Latin \textit{guttur throat}.)

The letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} stands for the glottal stop. In English the glottal stop is found in the negative \textit{uh-uh} and in Tagalog between the two vowels of the word \textit{daan}. At the end of syllables it became silent (quiescent) in most cases, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צבא} \textit{ṣāḇā(ʾ)} \textit{army}. In this grammar, the quiescient \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is transcribed \textit{(ʾ)} to indicate the presence of the letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} and the fact that is no longer a consonant.

The  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} /ḥ/ is a fricative sound that corresponds to /ḥ/ in Arabic, e.g., \textit{Muhammad}. As in Modern Hebrew, the /ḥ/ is usually pronounced like the fricative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כ} \textit{ḵ} as the final \textit{-ch} in the name of the German composer Bach or the Scottish-Gaelic word \textit{loch} (as in Loch Ness, the name of a lake on Scotland).

The \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} is the voiced counterpart to the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} /ḥ/. It is the same sound as the initial sound of the Arabic word \textit{ʿayn} \enquote{eye}. As in Modern Hebrew, the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} usually pronounced as the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}.  For a clearer distinction of the two consonants it is recommended to pronounce the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} with more force than the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}.


\section{Emphatic Consonants}
The three consonants \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ט}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק} are called emphatic because they are \enquote{articulated farther back in the mouth in the region called the soft palate, and with greater tension of the articulary organs than is the case for the non-emphatics} (JM §\,5\textit{i}).

\medskip

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
			\hline
			& emphatic & non-emphatic \\
			\hline
			Dental  & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ט} \textit{ṭ} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} \textit{t} \\
			Palatal-velar & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק} \textit{q} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כ} \textit{k} \\
			Sibilant  & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} \textit{ṣ} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ס} \textit{s} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	\bigskip

The emphatics \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ט} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק} should be pronounced with more force or emphasis than their non-emphatic counterparts \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כ} to avoid confusion. The traditional pronunciation of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} as \textit{ts} makes confusion with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ס} \textit{s} impossible.


\section{Semivowels}
The letters \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} represent so-called semivowels (sometimes also called semi-consonants). Technically, the semivowels are considered consonants. Originally, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} was pronounced as a bilabial sound \textit{w} as in Engl.\ \textit{well}. In Modern Hebrew it is pronounced as /v/ as in Engl. \textit{vase}. Its transliteration, however, is \textit{w}.

% The term semi-consonants is used in Blau, Phonology and Morphology

Semivowels often interact with vowels by merging with them to form long vowels. This process is called contraction.

\section{Vowel Letters}
Originally, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet only indicated consonants. As a consequence, readers of Hebrew texts had to supply all vowels by using their knowledge of the language.  Before 700 BCE, however, scribes introduced the use of three consonants for indicating vowels.

The letters \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} are used to indicate long vowels in the middle of words and at the end of words. The letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} only indicates vowels at the end of words. Originally, vowel letters were only used to indicate long vowels. The following vowels are indicated by these three vowel letters:

\bigskip

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.1\linewidth} p{0.70\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} & \textit{ō}, \textit{ū}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יום} \textit{yōm} \textit{day}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סוס} \textit{sūs} \textit{horse}   \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} & \textit{ī}, \textit{ē}, \textit{ǣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{איש} \textit{ʾīš} \textit{man}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בין} \textit{bēn} \textit{between}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בניך} \textit{bānǣḵā} \textit{your sons} \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} & \textit{ā}, \textit{ǣ}, \textit{ē}, \textit{ō} (only at the end of words), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אשה} \textit{ʾiššā} \textit{woman}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זה} \textit{zæ̂} \textit{this}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הנה} \textit{hinnê} \textit{look!}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כה} \textit{kô} \textit{thus}, \\
\end{tabular}

\end{center}

\bigskip

When vowels are written with a vowel letter, it is called \textit{plene} spelling (Latin \textit{scriptio plena} from Hebrew \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כתיב מלא} \textit{kətīḇ mālē(ʾ)} \textit{full spelling}). When vowels that could be spelled \textit{plene}, are spelled without vowel letter it is called defective spelling (Latin \textit{scriptio defectiva} from Hebrew \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כתיב מלא} \textit{kətīḇ ḥāsēr} \textit{defective spelling}).

Sometimes, vowel letters are used for short vowels, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כולם} \textit{kullām} \textit{all of them} (Jer 31:34; the form is otherwise spelled \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כלם}͏͏͏).

Traditional terms for vowel letters are the Latin \textit{mater lectionis} (singular) and \textit{matres lectionis} (plural) which are calques of the Hebrew terms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אם קריאה} \textit{ʾēm qərīʾā} \textit{mother of reading} (singular) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אמות קריאה} \textit{ʾimmōt qərīʾā} \textit{mothers of reading} (plural), respectively. In English, these terms are often shortened to \textit{mater} or \textit{matres}.

The letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is not a vowel letter in the proper sense. At the end of syllables /ʾ/ often became silent -- this happened always at the end of words -- but was retained in writing so that vowels appear to be written with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}. But unlike \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} which can be used as vowel letters even in positions where there was no semivowel /w/ or /y/ before, silent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} only occurs where there was once a consonantal /ʾ/ (exceptions are possible).

\section{Position of the Stress}
In Masoretic Hebrew, most words are stressed on the last (or ultimate) syllable. Exceptions to this are nouns with originally two final consonants (see Chapter 2) and a number of verbal forms.

In this grammar, the position of stress of a Hebrew word is indicated by the sign \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ ֫} on the stressed syllable when it is useful, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּאָ֫רֶץ} \textit{bāʾā́ræṣ} \textit{in the land}.


\section{Numerical Values of Letters}
The numerical value for Hebrew letters is a feature of postbiblical times. In Hebrew inscriptions from the First Temple period, hieratic number signs were used. In extant biblical manuscripts, number words are used instead of number signs. In English, this corresponds to using the word \textit{seventy} for the number 70.


\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Proper Nouns without Vowel Letters}
Identify the following proper nouns from the Hebrew Bible. The names do not contain vowel letters; every Hebrew character indicates a consonant. Use the vowels a, e, i, o, u (as they sound in Tagalog). Reminder: The letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ש} may represent either the sound /š/ or the sound /ś/.

\chapter{Chapter 2}

\section{The Vocalization of the Hebrew Bible}

The Masoretes, the Jewish scholars who worked on the transmission of the Hebrew Bible between 700 and 1000 CE, added an elaborate system of vowel signs and other signs to the biblical text to ensure its correct pronunciation. Each vowel was now indicated by a sign. As a result, some vowels are indicated twice -- once with a vowel letter and once with the vowel sign that was added by the Masoretes.

During the period from 700--1000~CE three competing vocalization systems were developed, the Tiberian, the Babylonian and the Palestinian system. In the history of the transmission of the Hebrew Bible, the Tiberian system became the standard vocalization system. It consists of sublinaer and supralinear vowel signs and additional signs to indicate the absence of a vowel, the plosive pronunciation of \textit{bəgadkəfat} letters and the doubling of consonants and other phonetic features.  The Hebrew term for the vocalization system is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ניקוד} (vocalized \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִקּוּד}) \textit{niqqūd}.

The existing biblical text to which the Masoretes added the pointing is often called the consonantal text. This term is not accurate because the biblical text contained vowel letters, i.e., letters that indicated vowels and not consonants. In this work, the term \enquote{unpointed text} is used instead of \enquote{consonantal text.}

\section{Full Vowels}

% The transliteration of vowels is taken from Blau, Phonology and Morphology, p. 66-67

Biblical Hebrew according to the Tiberian vocalization system has seven distinct vowels. Originally, the vowel signs only indicated vowel quality but not vowel quantity (length). The Tiberian system was later reinterpreted according to another reading tradition. This reinterpretation is presented here.

\noindent \textbf{Notes}
\nopagebreak

\noindent For grammatical explanations a simplified transliteration of the names of vowels and other signs will be used (\textit{ḥireq}, \textit{ṣere}, \textit{segol}, \textit{pataḥ}, \textit{qameṣ}, \textit{ḥolem}, \textit{qibbuṣ}, \textit{šureq}).

Vowels are pronounced after the consonant they are placed with. The combination \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַ}, for example, stands thus for /ma/.

The approximate pronunciation does not distinguish vowel length. Vowel quality is indicated only by approximation.

The \textit{qameṣ} indicating \textit{ā} is called \textit{qāmæṣ gādōl} (simplified \textit{qameṣ gadol}). The \textit{qameṣ} indicating \textit{ɔ} is called \textit{qāmæṣ qāṭān} or \textit{qāmæṣ ḥāṭūf} (simplified \textit{qameṣ qaṭan} and \textit{qameṣ ḥaṭuf}, respectively).

For the vowel /ū/ the sign \textit{qibbuṣ} is used when there is no vowel letter whereas \textit{šureq} is used when there is a vowel \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} in the unpointed text, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּקּוּדֶ֫יךָ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּקֻּדֶ֫יךָ} \textit{your precepts} (Ps 119:15, 27).

The vowel \textit{ḥolem} is the only vowel sign that is placed on the top left corner of the letter (except with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ל}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲלֹם} \textit{dream}). If combined with the vowel letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} the \textit{ḥolem} is placed on the  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוֺט} \textit{Lot}. If combined with a silent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} the \textit{ḥolem} is placed on the top right corner of the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֹאשׁ} \textit{head}. In some printed works the \textit{ḥolem} merges with the diacritic point of a following \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁ} or a preceding \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂ}. Examples: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{משֶׁה} instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֹשֶׁה}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂנַאֲךָ} instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֹׂנַאֲךָ} \textit{one who hates you}.

\section{The Distinction between \textit{qameṣ gadol} and \textit{qameṣ qaṭan}}
In the Tiberian vocalization system as it was intended, the \textit{qameṣ} only represented the vowel \textit{ɔ}. The distinction between \textit{qameṣ gadol} and \textit{qameṣ qaṭan} is the result of a later reinterpretation of the Tiberian vocalization system and is linguistically justified. A \textit{qameṣ} is a \textit{qameṣ qaṭan} (or \textit{qameṣ ḥaṭuf}) in the following cases:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item In closed, unstressed syllables, i.e., before silent \textit{šwa}, before \textit{maqqef} (see below) and before \textit{dageš forte} (infrequent), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָזְנִי} \textit{ʾɔznī} \textit{my ear} (from sg. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹ֫זֶן}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמָר־לְךָ} \textit{šəmɔr ləḵā} \textit{keep} (cf. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמֹר} without \textit{maqqef}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּסּוּ} \textit{kɔssū} \textit{they were covered}.
	\item In the first syllable of the plural noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָֽדָשִׁים} \textit{qɔdāšīm} (usually spelled with \textit{meteg}) because of the vowel \textit{ō} (< \textit{*u}) in the first syllable of the singular form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קֹ֫דֶשׁ}.
\end{enumerate}

The vowel \textit{qameṣ qaṭan} \textit{ɔ} always originates from a short /u/, whereas \textit{qameṣ gadol} goes back to an original /a/ or -- less frequently -- /ā/. If a word has the vowel \textit{qameṣ qaṭan} in a certain form, the vowel may appear either as \textit{ḥolem} or \textit{qibbuṣ} in other forms of the word, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֹק} \textit{ḥōq} \textit{statue}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֻקִּים} \textit{ḥuqqīm} \textit{statues} (pl.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָק־} \textit{ḥɔq} \textit{statue of} (construct state).

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent \textbf{Note}
\nopagebreak

\noindent The plural of the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּ֫יִת} \textit{báyit} \textit{house} is spelled \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּתִּים} but pronounced \textit{bātīm} with \textit{qameṣ gadol} and a single plosive /t/.


\section{The \textit{šwa}}

The sign \textit{šəwā} (simplified \textit{šwa}) consists of two dots under the letter that are arranged vertically: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{͏◌ְ} \space. Phonetically, the \textit{šwa} indicates the lack of a vowel. For the morphological analysis of words three different types of \textit{šwa} can be distinguished, the silent \textit{šwa}, the vocal \textit{šwa} and the medial \textit{šwa}.

\subsection{Silent \textit{šwa}}
The silent \textit{šwa} is used to mark vowelless consonants at the end of closed syllables except at the end of words, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַבְרָהָם} \textit{ʾaḇrāhām}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִדְבָּר} \textit{midbār} \textit{desert}.

In three cases silent \textit{šwa} is found at the end of words:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Words ending with the consonant /k/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַלְאָךְ} \textit{messenger, angel}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָבִיךְ} \textit{your} (fem.) \textit{father} (but \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָבִ֫יךָ} \textit{your} (masc.) \textit{father} with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ך} followed by a vowel)
	\item Words with two consonants at the end of the word, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁאַלְתְּ} \textit{you have asked}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּשְׁתְּ} \textit{and he drank}
	\item The independent personal pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתְּ} \textit{ʾat} \textit{you} (fem.\ sg.)
\end{enumerate}

The only words with silent \textit{šwa} at the beginning of the word are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתַּ֫יִם} \textit{štayim} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁנַ֫יִם} \textit{šnayim} \textit{two}.

\subsection{Vocal \textit{šwa}}
The vocal \textit{šwa} is used with the initial consonant of an originally open syllable in which the original short vowel was reduced, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּבָרִים} \textit{words} (\textit{< *dabarīm} with a reduced vowel in the first syllable; pl. of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָר} \textit{word} with two full vowels).

If possible, a consonant with vocal \textit{šwa} should be pronounced vowelless. For the sake of convenience, the vocal \textit{šwa} may be pronounced as a hurried \textit{e} as in the first syllable of Engl. \textit{atone} [əˈtoʊn], e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּגָדִים} \textit{bəgādīm} \textit{clothes} (with two plosives) as opposed to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סְפָרִים}, transliterated \textit{səfārīm}, pronounced [sfaːriːm] \textit{books}. Vocal \textit{šwa} is always transliterated \textit{ə} despite its vowelless pronunciation.

The following three criteria help to distinguish a vocal \textit{šwa} from a silent \textit{šwa}. A \textit{šwa} is a vocal \textit{šwa} in the following cases:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item \textit{šwa} at the beginning of the word, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פְּרִי} \textit{pərī} [priː] \textit{fruit}
	\item \textit{šwa} following \textit{šwa}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִשְׁפְּטֵי} \textit{mišpəṭē} \textit{precepts of}
	\item \textit{šwa} following a long vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֹׁפְטִים} \textit{šōp̄əṭīm} \textit{judges}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָמְרָה} \textit{ʾāmərā} \textit{she said}
	\item \textit{šwa} with a consonant with \textit{dageš forte} (see below), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דַּבְּרוּ} \textit{dabbərū} \textit{speak!} (impv.\ masc.\ pl.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Medial \textit{šwa}}

When two open syllables with reduced vowels would have to follow each other immediately, the first consonant gets a full short vowel (often /i/) and the second consonant gets a silent \textit{šwa}. This particular \textit{šwa}, however, does not cause the following \textit{bəgadkəfat} letter to become plosive, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּזְבֵי} \textit{kizḇē- < *kazaḇē} \textit{lies of somebody} (from \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּזָב} \textit{lie}). In this respect this \textit{šwa} is different from the regular silent \textit{šwa} (cf. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִדְבָּר} \textit{midbār} above) and therefore it is called medial \textit{šwa} or \textit{šwa medium}.

\subsection{Composite \textit{šwa} with Gutturals}

Gutturals do not take simple vocal \textit{šwa}. Instead they take \textit{ḥatef šwa} (also called composite \textit{šwa}). When a guttural would have to take silent \textit{šwa}, it is frequently replaced by \textit{ḥatef šwa} of the same vowel quality as the preceding full vowel.

\textit{Ḥatef šwa} for for vocal \textit{šwa} is found in the following words: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲצִי} \textit{ḥăṣī} \textit{half} (cf. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פְּרִי} \textit{pərī} \textit{fruit}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱמֶת} \textit{ʾæ̆mæt} \textit{truth}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֳנִי} \textit{ʿɔ̆nī} \textit{misery}.

\textit{Ḥatef šwa} for silent \textit{šwa} is found in the following words: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעֲמֹד} \textit{yaʿămōd < *yaʿmōd} \textit{he will stand}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶאֱהַב} \textit{yæʾæ̆haḇ < *yæʾhaḇ} \textit{he will love}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָעֳמַד} \textit{yɔʿɔ̆mad < *yɔʿmad} \textit{he shall be placed}.

At times, even non-gutturals may have \textit{ḥatef šwa} instead vocal \textit{šwa}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סוֺרֲרִים} \textit{sōrărĭm} \textit{stubborn ones} (Ps 68:7).


\section{The \textit{dageš}}

The \textit{dāgēš} (simplified \textit{dageš}) is a point in the middle of the letter: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{◌ּ} \space. It has two functions. The \textit{dageš} either indicates the doubling of a consonant or the plosive pronunciation of \textit{bəgadkəfat} letters.

\subsection{\textit{dageš forte}}

The \textit{dageš} in a consonant with a preceding full short vowel indicates \emph{doubling} (or \emph{gemination}) of the consonant, i.e., its long pronunciation, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רַכָּב} \textit{rakkāḇ} \textit{charioteer}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַמִּים} \textit{ʿammīm} \textit{nations}. When used in this way, the \textit{dageš} is called \textit{dageš forte} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּגֵשׁ חָזָק}. A \textit{dageš forte} in \textit{bəgadkəfat} letters causes them to be pronounced as plosives, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לִבּוֺ} \textit{libbō} \textit{his heart}.

In the course of the history of Hebrew, gutturals and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} lost the ability to be doubled (with few exceptional cases of doubled \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר}). As a result, the letters \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} do not take \textit{dageš forte}. In Biblical Hebrew, the vowels preceding \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} that stand in a position where other consonants would be doubled, are normally preserved unchanged despite the fact that they now are in an open syllable (see Syllable Structure below). Vowels preceding \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} are usually lengthened (/a/ > /ā/, /i/ > /ē/, /u/ > /ō/) although preservation of the short vowel may also occur. Before \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} the vowels are always lengthened (/a/ > /ā/, /i/ > /ē/, /u/ > /ō/). Examples:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rll}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רַחוּם} & \textit{raḥūm < *raḥḥūm} & \textit{compassionate} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רָעִים} & \textit{rāʿīm < *raʿʿīm} & \textit{bad, evil} (pl.) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָרָשׁ} & \textit{ḥārāš < *ḥarrāš} & \textit{craftsman} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{\textit{dageš lene}}

In \textit{bəgadkəfat} letters, the \textit{dageš lene} indicates the plosive pronunciation as /b/, /g/, /d/, /k/, /p/ and /t/, respectively. These letters are pronounced as plosives and are therefore marked with a \textit{dageš lene} when 

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item At the beginning of a sentence, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{} \textit{My friend had a vineyard} (Isa 5:1b)
	\item At the beginning of a word following a word ending with a consonant, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{} \textit{I raised sons} (Isa 1:2a)
	\item In the middle of a word immediately after a consonant, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִדְבָּר} \textit{midbār} \textit{desert}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִשְׁכָּב} \textit{miškāḇ} \textit{place of lying}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִשְׁפָּט} \textit{mišpāṭ} \textit{judgment}
\end{enumerate}

A \textit{dageš} in a \textit{bəgadkəfat} letter can be either be a \textit{dageš forte} or a \textit{dageš lene}. If a full short vowel precedes the \textit{bəgadkəfat} letter, it is a \textit{dageš forte}. In all other cases it is a \textit{dageš lene}. The Hebrew term for \textit{dageš lene} is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּגֵשׁ קַל}.

\section{\textit{Mappiq}}
If the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} at the end of a word is not a vowel letter but indicates a consonant, it is marked by a point in the middle of the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} called \textit{mappīq} (simplified \textit{mappiq}). Examples: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמָהּ} \textit{šəmāh} \textit{her name}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַלְכָּהּ} \textit{malkāh} \textit{her king} (as opposed to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַלְכָּה} \textit{malkā} \textit{queen} with the femimine ending \textit{-ā}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱלֹהַּ} \textit{ʾæ̆lṓah} \textit{God} (with \textit{furtive pataḥ}).

\section{\textit{Furtive pataḥ}}
Words ending with the gutturals \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} preceded by a long vowel other than /ā/ require the insertion of a short vowel /a/ before the guttural. This /a/ is called \textit{furtive pataḥ}. It is placed under the guttural but pronounced before it. The \textit{furtive pataḥ} is \emph{not} stressed. Examples: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָשִׁיחַ} \textit{māšī́aḥ} \textit{anointed one}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֵעַ} \textit{rḗaʿ} \textit{friend}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּבֹהַּ} \textit{gāḇṓah} \textit{high, tall}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רוּחַ} \textit{rū́aḥ} \textit{wind, spirit}.

\section{\textit{Meteg}}
The \textit{méteg} is a short vertical stroke to the left of the vowel sign. It indicates that the pronunciation of the syllable should not be hasty (\textit{meteg} means \textit{bridle}). It often marks the secondary stress of a word or expression. In some cases, it helps distinguish forms that look identical but are to be pronounced differently and have a different meaning. In biblical manuscripts the \textit{meteg} is not used consistently. Examples: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּֽרְאוּ} \textit{wayyīrəʾū} \textit{and they were afraid} (1 Sam 7:7; often the form is spelled plene \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּירְאוּ}) as opposed to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּרְאוּ} \textit{wayyirʾū} \textit{and they saw} (never with \textit{meteg}).


\section{\textit{Maqqef}}
The \textit{maqqēf} line (simplified \textit{maqqef}) or \textit{linea maqqef} connects two or more words so that they form a stress unit with only one main stressed syllable in  the last word of the unit, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית־אָבִ֫יךָ} (Gen 24:23). In many cases the last vowel of the word before the \textit{maqqēf} line is changed, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתֹב} \textit{kətoḇ} \textit{write} (impv.) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתָב־לְךָ} \textit{kətɔḇ ləkā} \textit{write} (impv.) (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְךָ} is extremely difficult to translate into English; Exod 34:27).

\section{Syllable Structure}
Biblical Hebrew has a relatively simple syllable structure. Most syllables are either open syllables that end in a vowel (or vocal \textit{šwa} or \textit{ḥatef šwa}) (CV) or closed syllables that end in a consonant (CVC). Doubly closed syllables ending in two consonants (a so-called consonant cluster) (CVCC) are infrequent. The following table gives an overview of possible syllables:

\bigskip

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
		Open syllable & CV \\
		Closed syllable & CVC \\
		Doubly closed syllable & CVCC \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\bigskip

\noindent For a proper understanding of syllable structure, the following notes are important:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Every syllable must begin with a consonant.
	\item Open syllables (CV) include syllables with vocal \textit{šwa} or \textit{ḥatef šwa} for historical reasons. The vocal \textit{šwa} or \textit{ḥatef šwa} are the result of the reduction of short vowels.
	\item In unstressed closed syllables only short vowel are possible.
	\item In unstressed open syllables short vowels are not possible, only long vowels or reduced vowels are possible. An exception to this rule are cases of the loss of gemination in gutturals with preservation of the short vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רַחוּם} \textit{raḥūm < *raḥḥūm} \textit{compassionate}.
	\item Syllables with the structure CVCC only occur at the end of words and almost exclusively as the final syllable of verbal forms.
	\item Exceptions to these syllabification rules are the words for \textit{two} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁנַ֫יִם} \textit{šnayim} (masc.) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתַּ֫יִם} \textit{štayim} (fem.) with two initial consonants.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Segolate Nouns}

% More information is contained in the file Hebrew_Segolate_nouns.odt. The contents have been simplified here.

Biblical Hebrew words are usually stressed on the final syllable. A relatively high number of words, however, are stressed on the penultimate syllable. To this group belong a number of verbal forms and the so-called segolate nouns. As they are relatively frequent it is important to know the patterns of segolate nouns so that their correct pronunciation is ensured.

Originally Hebrew had only three short vowels (/a/, /i/, /u/) and three long vowels. These original vowels were subject to change over time. Segolate nouns give evidence to this.

Segolate nouns are originally monosyllabic nouns with a CVCC syllable structure. After the loss of the final short vowel indicating case (e.g., \textit{*malku > *malk}) in an early phase of Hebrew, the resulting final consonant cluster -CC was broken up by insertion of a helping vowel (also called epenthetic or anaptyptic vowel). In most cases the helping vowel is \textit{segol} (therefore the term \textit{segolate nouns}). Three basic patterns (\textit{*qaṭl},\textit{*qiṭl}, \textit{*quṭl}) can be distinguished.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|}
		\hline
		\textit{*qaṭl} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶ֫לֶךְ} & \textit{king} \\
		\hline
		\textit{*qiṭl} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סֵ֫פֶר} & \textit{book} \\
		\hline
		\textit{*quṭl} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קֹ֫דֶשׁ} & \textit{holiness} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent If the second or/and the third root consonants are gutturals or semi-vowels, segolate nouns have different vowel patterns than the basic patterns. Except for roots with the semivowel \textit{y} in third position the stress is on the original vowel and thus on the penultimate syllable.

\begin{center}
	\begin{longtable}{|ll|rl|}
		\hline
		\textit{*qaṭl} & & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶ֫לֶךְ} & \textit{king} \\
		& II\,gutt. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נַ֫עַר} & \textit{boy} \\
		& III\,gutt. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֶ֫רַע} & \textit{seed} \\
		& II\,\textit{w} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָ֫וֶת} & \textit{death} \\
		& III\,\textit{w} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂ֫חוּ} & \textit{swimming} \\
		& II\,\textit{y} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זַ֫יִת} & \textit{olive} \\
		& III\,\textit{y} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גְּדִי} & \textit{kid} \\
		\hline
		\textit{*qiṭl} & & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סֵ֫פֶר} & \textit{book} \\
		& II\,gutt. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נֵ֫צַח} & \textit{everlastingness} \\
		& III\,\textit{y} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁבִי} & \textit{captivity} \\
		\hline
		\textit{*quṭl} & & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קֹ֫דֶשׁ} & \textit{holiness} \\
		& II\,gutt. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פֹּ֫עַל} & \textit{deed, work} \\
		& III\,gutt. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֹ֫מַח} & \textit{spear} \\
		& III\,\textit{w} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֹּ֫הוּ} & \textit{wilderness} \\
		& III\,\textit{y} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֳלִי} & \textit{sickness} \\
		\hline
	\end{longtable}
\end{center}

It is important to be familiar with these patterns. When one encounters them in the biblical text with different consonants, one should be able to recognize the pattern as a segolate formation.

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Notes}
\nopagebreak

\noindent In segolate nouns of the \textit{qaṭl} type the original vowel /a/ has been assimilated to the anaptyptic vowel /æ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֶּ֫לֶת} \textit{door}. In roots with a guttural the helping vowel is usually /a/ because of the preference of gutturals for /a/.

Some nouns in the II gutt.\ category have the helping vowel /æ/ instead of /a/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֶ֫חֶם} \textit{bread}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֶ֫חֶם} \textit{womb}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אׂ֫הֶל} \textit{tent}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֹּ֫הֶן} \textit{thumb}.

The first vowel of pausal forms of \textit{qaṭl} segolate nouns is usually changed to /ā/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּ֑רֶךְ} \textit{way} (context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֶּ֫רֶךְ}; but \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶ֑לֶךְ} \textit{king})

In some nouns the vowel may shift from the position following the first root consonant to the position between the second and third radical, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּבַשׁ} \textit{honey}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁכֶם} \textit{shoulder}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּאֵר} \textit{well}.

Segolate endings also appear in polysyllabic nouns, dual endings of nouns, and verbal forms with an original final syllable with the structure CVCC, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּכֵ֫לֶת} \textit{purple wool}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְחׂ֫שֶׁת} \textit{bronze}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָדַ֫יִם} \textit{hands} (dual), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּ֫בֶן} \textit{he built}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּשְׁתַּ֫חוּ} \textit{he prostrated}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְהִי} \textit{may it be} (< \textit{*yihy}).

Proper nouns can be segolate nouns or contain a segolate ending, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶ֫רֶד} \textit{Jared}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קַ֫יִן} \textit{Cain}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵלִיָּ֫הוּ} \textit{Elijah}.


\section{Pausal Forms}

When the reader or speaker is supposed to slow down at the end of a sentence and pause briefly before continuing with the next sentence, the form of the word my slightly change at times. The meaning of the form is not affected by this change. This happens frequently at the end of a verse or the middle of verse, but it may happen also in other places in a verse. These forms are called \emph{pausal forms} as opposed to the more frequent \emph{context forms}. The following changes may can be observed:

% References for the examples: Ruth 4:2; Gen 14:19; Gen 18:2; Gen 24:52; Gen 4:9; Gen 7:4

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item[--] Lengthening of the stressed vowel, e.g., pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֫רְצָה} vs. the context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַ֫רְצָה} \textit{to the ground}
	\item[--] Change of vowel quality, e.g., pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֫רֶץ} vs. the context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶ֫רֶץ} \textit{land} 
	\item[--] Stress moves to a different syllable, e.g., pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹ֫כִי} vs. the context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹכִ֫י} \textit{I}
	\item[--] Restoration of a reduced vowel which takes the stress, e.g., pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּשֵׁ֫בוּ} vs. the context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּשְׁב֫וּ} \textit{and they sat down, settled}
\end{itemize}

In this grammar, both context forms and pausal forms are included in the explanation of forms. Pausal forms are indicated by the accent \textit{atnaḥ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ ֑}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹ֑כִי}.

Read Gen 1:1--8. Stress of words that are stressed on the penultimate syllable is marked.

% Stress is marked because I don't want students to put the stress on the wrong syllable when reading a text from the Bible for the first time.
% One could add assignments to this, such as searching for vowel letters, saying the names of letters and vowel signs, identifying segolate formations.

\section{Frequent Verbal Forms}
Verbs are the most important part of speech in Biblical Hebrew. Among the verbal forms, weak forms are very frequent, i.e., verbal forms that do not have three root consonants but only two or sometimes only one instead of the three root consonants of the strong verb. In order to make it easier to become familiar with verbal forms, the most frequent verbal forms are introduced as vocabulary in chapters 3 and 4.

The first set of ten forms of five verbs is in the section Vocabulary above; the second set is in the vocabulary of chapter 4. At this state, it is sufficient to memorize the forms and their meanings without understanding how the forms are actually formed.

The twenty verbal forms in the vocabulary of chapters 3 and 4 are about 10\,\% of all verbal forms in the Hebrew Bible. All forms of these ten verbs make up about 30\,\% of the total number of verbal forms in the Hebrew Bible. These figures make it clear that it is essential to be familiar with these twenty verbal forms in particular and the ten verbs in general. Only two of the ten verbs are strong verbs, i.e., verbs that have three root consonants in \emph{all} their forms.

The most frequent forms that are introduced in chapters 3 and 4, are the 3 masc.\ sg.\ suffix conjugation (SC) form  and the 3 masc.\ sg.\ \textit{waw}-prefix conjugation (\textit{waw}-PC) or \textit{wayyiqṭol} form. The SC usually has past tense meaning (simple past, present perfect or past perfect depending on the context). The \textit{waw}-PC serves as simple past (preterite). Chains of \textit{waw}-PC forms are the backbone of narratives in the Hebrew Bible. \textit{waw}-PC forms are always placed in first position in the clause. The other forms of the SC and PC will be introduced in later chapters.

\section{The Verbal Clause}
A clause with a finite verbal form (i.e., a form that is marked for person, 1st \textit{I}, 2nd \textit{you}, or 3rd person \textit{he, she, it}) as predicate is called \textit{verbal clause}. Most clauses in biblical literature are verbal clauses. The other type of clause is the verbless or nominal clause.

With a finite verb as predicate there is no need for an explicit (overt) subject because the subject is contained in the verbal form, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּרְא} \textit{and he saw}. With an overt subject the verbal form is to be rendered only as a verbal form, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּרְא יַעֲקֹב} \textit{and Jacob saw}.

If a clause includes an overt subject, the subject and the verbal predicate agree with each other in number, gender and -- in the case of 1st or 2nd person verbal forms -- in person. This means, for example, that a common noun as subject that is masculine and singular, is combined with a masc.\ sg.\ verbal form (in the 3rd person). There are, however, exceptions to this rule.

The most common constituent order is verb-subject-object (VSO). As a consequence, the function of a constituent is often indicated by its position in the clause. Subjects normally precede direct objects, indirect objects or prepositional objects. Indirect objects usually follow direct objects. Adverbial phrases tend to be put at the end of the clause although temporal adverbial expressions are often placed up front. The length of constituents also plays a role. Short constituents, e.g., pronouns or short adverbs, have the tendency to be placed earlier in the clause. In most cases, the meaning of the verb and context help in identifying the function of clause constituents.

Any constituent maybe be fronted, that is, placed before the verb. The result is marked constituent order. There is usually a specific reason for employing marked constituent order. Usually, it is the activation or reactivation of a topic (also for contrast) or putting a constituent in focus, that is, highlighting it as the most salient constituent of the clause.


\section{The Definite Article}
Different from English but similar to Greek, Biblical Hebrew only has a definite article. Its use is similar to the use of the definite article \textit{the} in English but there are quite many differences in the use of the definite article between the two languages. Most frequently, the definite article is used when an entity can be identified by both the speaker and the addressee in the context of the communication. 


The  Hebrew definite article is directly prefixed to the noun. Its basic form is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{◌ּ}\space\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַ}, i.e., \textit{ha-} followed by \textit{dageš forte} in the first consonant of the noun. This is illustrated by the following examples:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rlrl}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶלֶךְ} & \textit{king} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַמֶּלֶךְ} & \textit{the king} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָד} & \textit{hand} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַיָּד} & \textit{the hand} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִזְבֵּחַ} & \textit{altar} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַמִּזְבֵּחַ} & \textit{the altar} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If the noun begins with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְ} \textit{yə-} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְ} \textit{mə-}, the \textit{dageš forte} of the article is usually lost, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַיְהוּדִים} \textit{the Judeans}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַמְרַגְּלִים} \textit{the spies}.

As the consonants \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} are not geminated there is no \textit{dageš} in the first consonant of the noun if it begins with a guttural or /r/. The following rules apply with in regard to the vowel of the article:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item If the noun begins with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח}, the \textit{pataḥ} of the article is preserved in the open syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַהֵיכָל} \textit{the temple}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַחֶרֶב} \textit{the sword}. Frequent exceptions to this rule are the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַר} \textit{mountain}, which is  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָהָר} with the article, and the independent personal pronoun 3 m./f.\ pl. with the article as demonstrative pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָהֵם}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָהֵ֫מָּה} (masc.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָהֵ֫נָּה} [fem.] (in the singular, however one finds \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַהוּא} [masc.] and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַהִיא} [fem.], see below).
	\item If the noun begins with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר}, the \textit{pataḥ} of the article is changed to \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאֵשׁ} \textit{the fire}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָעִיר} \textit{the city}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָרֹאשׁ} \textit{the head}.
	\item If the noun begins with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} followed by unstressed \textit{qameṣ}, the \textit{pataḥ} of the article is changed to \textit{segol}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶהָרִים} \textit{the mountains}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶעָרִים} \textit{the cities}.
	\item Likewise, if the noun begins with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} followed by stressed or unstressed \textit{qameṣ gadol} or \textit{ḥatef qameṣ}, the \textit{pataḥ} of the article is changed to \textit{segol}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶחָכָם} \textit{the wise one}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶחָג} \textit{the feast}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶחֳדָשִׁים} \textit{the new moons} (i.e., the festivals held at new moon).
\end{enumerate}

Some nouns change their vowels to the vowel of the pausal form of the noun when they are used with the article, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאָ֫רֶץ} \textit{the land, the earth} (context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶרֶץ} \textit{land, earth}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָהָר} \textit{the mountain} (context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַר} \textit{mountain}). In a similar way, the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲרוֺן} \textit{ark, chest} with the article is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאָרוֺן} \textit{the ark}.

Common nouns may be used with the article to indicate the vocative function, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֹּ֫אמֶר הוֹשִׁ֫עָה הַמֶּ֫לֶךְ} \textit{And she said, \enquote{Help, O king!}} (2\,Sam 14:4); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֶּן־מִי אַתָּה הַנָּעַר} \textit{Whose son are you, young man?} (1\,Sam 17:58).

As Hebrew does not have an indefinite article, an expression like \textit{a great nation} in English is simply \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גּוֺי גָּדוֺל} in Hebrew, i.e., only the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גּוֺי} with the attributive adjective \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּדוֺל}.


\section{Demonstrative Pronouns}
Unlike English with \textit{this}, \textit{these} and \textit{that}, \textit{those} or Greek with \foreignlanguage{greek}{οὗτος} etc.\ \textit{this} and \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἐκεῖνος} etc. \textit{that}, Biblical Hebrew has only one set of demonstrative pronouns. In the singular there are distinct forms for masc.\ and fem.\ while in the plural there is only one form with common gender. The function of the demonstrative pronouns as deictic elements is to point to specific entities in the communicative situation or the immediate context.

\medskip

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|ll|rl|}
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{sg.} & masc. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֶה} & \multirow{2}{*}{\textit{this}} \\
		& fem. &  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֹאת} & \\
		\hline
		pl. & comm. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵ֫לֶּה} & \textit{these} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent \textbf{Note}
\nopagebreak

\noindent The \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} in the fem.\ sg.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֹאת} \textit{zō(ʾ)t} is silent.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Demonstrative pronouns can either be used independently as subject or direct object replacing a noun or they can be used as attributes depending on nouns. When they are used as attributes, they follow the noun and both the noun and the demonstrative pronoun have the definite article. The demonstrative pronoun agrees with the noun it modifies in number and -- in the singular -- in gender. As the plural form is common gender it can be used with both masc. and fem. nouns.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rl}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִישׁ הַזֶּה} & \textit{this man} (masc.) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִשָּׁה הַזֹּאת} & \textit{this woman} (fem.) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵ֫לֶּה} & \textit{these words} (masc.) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַבְּרָכוֹת הָאֵ֫לֶּה} & \textit{these blessings} (fem.) \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For far deixis (pointing to something at a distance, e.g., Engl. \textit{that} or Greek \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἐκεῖνος}, Biblical Hebrew uses the 3rd person personal pronoun following the modified noun. Both the noun and the personal pronoun have the article. The personal pronoun agrees with the noun in number and gender.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rl}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִישׁ הַהוּא} & \textit{that man} (masc.) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִשָּׁה הַהִיא} & \textit{that woman} (fem.) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאֲנָשִׁים הָהֵ֫מָּה} & \textit{those men} (masc.) \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The demonstrative pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֶה} can be used as adverb with local or temporal deictic function with the meanings \textit{here}, \textit{there} or \textit{now}.

Rare forms of the demonstrative pronoun are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֹה} \textit{this} (fem.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַלָּזֶה} \textit{this} (masc.) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַלָּז} \textit{this} (comm.).

\section{The Prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ}}
Prepositions are a small set of expressions that are frequently used and very important. Their function is to denote the relations between elements in the outside world that speech refers to, or between elements of a clause. In this section the three prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} are introduced. They are extremely frequent with about 20,275, 15,570 and 2,895 occurrences in the Hebrew Bible, respectively.

% Figures for ל and ב are taken from Jenni's monographs on these prepositions.

Formally, these three prepositions are characterized by the fact that they are not separate words but are attached directly to the following word. Therefore, they are called \emph{proclitic} prepositions (as opposed to the other prepositions which are separate words).

The prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} have a number of different meanings and functions that cannot be exhaustively explained here. The standard lexica contain more detailed information. In this context a short overview of meanings must be sufficient.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rl}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} & \textit{to, for, in regard to}, also indicating indirect objects \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} & \textit{in, at, with} (local and temporal)\\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} & \textit{like, as, according to} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When prefixed to a word beginning with a syllable with a full vowel (except the definite article) the prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} appear in the forms as in the overview above, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְמֹשֶׁה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּמֹשֶׁה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּמֹשֶׁה}.

The prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} have deviating forms in the following circumstances:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item If the prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} are prefixed to a noun with the article, the /h/ of the article is lost but the vowel of the article is preserved, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לַמֶּלֶךְ} \textit{to the king}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָעָם} \textit{for the people}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֶּהָרִים} \textit{in the mountains}.
	\item If prefixed to a word beginning with vocal \textit{šwa} (except words beginning with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְ} \textit{yə-}), the three prepositions have the full vowel /i/ and the vocal \textit{šwa} becomes a medial \textit{šwa}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לִבְרִית עוֹלָם} \textit{for an everlasting covenant}.
	\item If prefixed to a word beginning with \textit{ḥatef šwa}, the three prepositions take the full vowel that corresponds to the \textit{ḥatef šwa} and the \textit{ḥatef šwa} itself remains unchanged, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לַחֲמֹרוֺ} \textit{to his donkey}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֶּאֱמֶת} \textit{in faithfulness, faithfully}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָחֳלִי} \textit{lɔḥɔ̆lī} \textit{to sickness}.
	\item If prefixed to a word beginning with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְ} \textit{yə-}, the preposition is followed by a long vowel /ī/ which is the result of the contraction of the short vowel /i/ and the following semivowel (\textit{*bəyə- > *biy- > bī-}), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּיהוּדָה} \textit{in Judah} (basic form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְהוּדָה})
	\item Before words that are stressed on the first syllable the prepositions sometimes have the vowel \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָרֹב} \textit{abundantly}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּזֶה} \textit{here}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּאֵלֶּה} \textit{like them}.
	\item If the three preposition are to be prefixed to the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱלֹהִים} \textit{God} or to a form of the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָדוֺן} \textit{lord} other than the citation form, the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} of these nouns becomes silent although it is retained in writing, and the following \textit{ḥatef šwa} is changed to a full vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֵאלֹהִים} \textit{lē(ʾ)lōhīm} \textit{to God} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לַאדֹנִי} \textit{la(ʾ)dōnī} \textit{to my lord} (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} + \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲדֹנִי}).
\end{enumerate}



\section{The Conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ}}
The function of the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} is to connect words, phrases and clauses. Its meaning is \textit{and} although in many cases a different rendering like \textit{but} or \textit{or} is more appropriate in English. It is also called a coordinating conjunction.

The most common form of the conjunction is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} \textit{wə-} which is directly prefixed to the following word, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְאַבְרָהָם} \textit{and Abraham}.

The conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} has deviating forms in the following circumstances:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item If the following word begins with a vocal \textit{šwa}, the conjunction is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּ} \textit{ū}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּדְבַר־הַמֶּלֶךְ} \textit{and the word of the king} (This is an exception to the rule that every word must begin with a consonant.)
	\item If the following word begins with a labial consonant, i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מ}, and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פ}, the conjunction is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּ} \textit{ū}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּמֹשֶׁה} \textit{and Moses}. (This is another exception to the rule that every word must begin with a consonant.)
	\item If the conjunction connects two words and the second one is stressed on the first syllable, especially in the case of common word pairs, the form of the conjunction is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָ} \textit{wā-}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קֹר וָחֹם וְקַ֫יִץ וָחֹ֫רֶף וְיוֹם וָלַ֫יְלָה} \textit{cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night} (Gen 8:22 with three word pairs).
	\item With words beginning with a vocal \textit{šwa} or \textit{ḥatef šwa}, the vowel of the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} resembles the vowels of the proclitic prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ}.
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item Conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} + word beginning with \textit{ḥatef šwa}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַחֲמֹרִים} \textit{and donkeys}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וֶאֱמֶת} \textit{and truth}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָחֳלִי} \textit{wɔḥɔ̆lī} \textit{and sickness}
		\item Conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} + word beginning with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְ} \textit{yə-}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וִיהוּדָה} \textit{and Judah}
		\item Conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} + the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱלֹהִים} or a form of the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָדוֺן} \textit{lord} other than the citation form: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וֵאלֹהִים} \textit{wē(ʾ)lōhĭm} \textit{and God}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַאדֹנִי} \textit{wa(ʾ)dōnĭ} \textit{and my lord}, both with silent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item In the case of \textit{waw}-PC form (or \textit{wayyiqṭol} form) the form of the conjunction is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{◌ּ}\space\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַ} (\textit{wa-} with following \textit{dageš forte}).
\end{enumerate}

The /h/ of the article is preserved after the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָאָרֶץ} \textit{and the earth}.


\section{Differential Object Marking}
Differential object marking means that only a more or less well defined part of direct objects is explicitly marked as such while the rest of the direct objects is not.

\subsection{The Use of the Object Marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{את}}
In Biblical Hebrew only definite direct objects are marked with the object marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת} (with \textit{maqqef} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶת־}). This word does not have a meaning and, therefore, does not have a translation equivalent. It only has the function of marking the direct object.

Not all definite direct objects, however, are marked. Proper nouns as direct objects have the highest percentage of marked elements in prose texts (97\,\%) whereas only 73\,\% of definite common nouns as direct objects are marked. It should, therefore, not be surprising to find relatively many definite direct objects that are not marked with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת}. The following nouns are definite:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Proper nouns, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִצְחָק}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֶבְרוֺן}
	\item Nouns with the definite article, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַמֶּלֶךְ} \textit{the king}
	\item Nouns with enclitic personal pronouns, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּיתִי} \textit{my house}
	\item Nouns with a definite dependent noun in a construct chain, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית הַמֶּלֶךְ} \textit{the house of the king}
\end{enumerate}

The use of the object marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת} is illustrated in the exercises.

In the Hebrew Bible, there are only very few indefinite direct objects that are marked with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת}.

Sometimes, the object marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת} is used with nouns as adverbial expressions of time and place.

\subsection{Ellipsis of Direct Objects}

Direct objects do not need to be included in the clause if they can be easily retrieved from the immediate context. As a consequence, Biblical Hebrew does not need to have a direct object where English has a personal pronoun as direct object.

\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Gen 21:27a consists of two clauses. In the first one, the verbal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקַּח} has the direct object \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צֹאן וּבָקָר} (two coordinated indefinite nouns). In the second clause with the verbal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּתֵּן} there is only the indirect object \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לַאֲבִימֶלֶךְ} and no direct object because it can be easily supplied from the immediately preceding clause.

Direct objects may also be omitted when they can be easily supplied from common knowledge.

\section{The Prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶל}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַל} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן}}
The prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶל} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַל} are always separate words. The Preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַל} is very often followed by \textit{maqqef}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶל} almost always.

The preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} is a separate word before nouns with the definite article, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן־הַמִּזְבֵּחַ} \textit{from the alter}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן־הַשָּׂדֶה} \textit{from the field}.

In other cases, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} is put immediately in front of the following word. As a consequence, the /n/ of the preposition is immediately followed by another consonant and therefore it is assimilated to that consonant. The following sound changes take place:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Assimilation of the /n/ to the first consonant of the following noun which is doubled as a consequence, e.g., \textit{*min-miṣráyim > mimmiṣráyim} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמִּצְרַיִם}  \textit{from Egypt}, \textit{*min-gilʿād > miggilʿād} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִגִּלְעָד} \textit{from Gilead}
	\item If the following word begins with a guttural or /r/, the /n/ is also assimilated to the  first consonant of the following word but the vowel of the preposition is changed to \textit{ṣere} and the first consonant of the following word is \emph{not} doubled, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵאֶפְרַיִם} \textit{mēʾæp̄ráyim < *miʾʾæp̄ráyim < *min-ʾæp̄ráyim} \textit{from Ephraim}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵחֶבְרוֺן} \textit{mēḥæḇrōn < *miḥḥæḇrōn < min-ḥæḇrōn} \textit{from Hebron}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵרָחוֺק} \textit{from a distance}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵאֱלֹהִים} \textit{from God}. This may also happen with the direct article, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵהַמֶּלֶךְ}  \textit{from the king}.
	\item The doubling of the first consonant before vocal \textit{šwa} is often lost, e.g. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִקְצֵה} \textit{miqṣē < miqqəṣē} \textit{at the end of} (noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָצֶה} \textit{end} with the prep. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן}).
	\item With a word beginning with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְ} \textit{yə-} assimilation of the /n/, loss of the doubling of the /y/ and contraction of \textit{-iy- > -ī-} takes place, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִיהוּדָה} \textit{mīhūdā < miyyəhūdā < min-yəhūdā}.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Other Local Adverbial Expressions}
In addition to prepositional phrases, Biblical Hebrew uses other means to express spatial and local relations (e.g., \textit{to, towards, in} etc.)

\subsection{The Locative He}
The locative He is the ending \textit{-ā} that is attached to a noun or adverb to indicate the goal of a motion. The locative He is \emph{not} stressed and can be used with common nouns, proper nouns or adverbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַבַּ֫יְתָה} \textit{into the house}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֶבְר֫וֺנָה} \textit{to Hebron}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁ֫מָּה} \textit{there} (as in \textit{They went there}).

With feminine nouns with the ending \textit{-ā} the locative He is attached to the construct state form (see below), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַזָּה} \textit{Gaza}, with locative He \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַזָּ֫תָה} \textit{to Gaza}.

% Other example \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רַבָּה} \textit{Rabbah}, with locative He \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רַבָּ֫תָה} \textit{to Rabbah} as in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּלֶךְ רַבָּ֫תָה} \textit{and he went to Rabbah} (2\,Sam 12:29)

\subsection{Noun Phrases}
Bare noun phrases without preposition or the locative He can also be used as adverbial expressions indicating spatial relations (\textit{to, towards, in, at} etc.), e.g., the place name \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית־אֵל} in the clause \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּבֹא הָעָם בֵּית־אֵל} \textit{And the people came to Bethel}.

Bare noun phrases may also be used to indicate time, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַלַּיְלָה} \textit{this night, tonight} (2\,Sam 19:8), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַשָּׁנִים הָאֵלֶּה} \textit{these years, during these years} (1\,Kgs 17:1). Other adverbial functions are possible, too.


\section{Vowel Changes}
Originally, Biblical Hebrew had the following vowels:

\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.4}

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Short Vowels & Long Vowels \\
		\hline
		\textit{i} & \textit{ī} \\
		\textit{a} & \textit{ā} \\
		\textit{u} & \textit{ū} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\noindent These vowels were subject to change in various ways over the course of time. The following outline summarizes the main changes that are relevant for understanding the morphology of Biblical Hebrew.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The long vowel /ā/ changed to /ō/ in stressed syllables at a very early date (cp. Hebrew \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלוֺם} \textit{peace} with its cognates in Aramaic \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלָם} and Arabic \textit{salām}).
	\item Originally long vowels are usually not subject to change. This applies also to long vowels originating from contraction of diphthongs (semivowel /y/ or /w/ + vowel), e.g., \textit{-ay} > \textit{-ē} or \textit{-aw} > \textit{-ō}.
	\item Originally short vowels in closed syllables are preserved.
	\item Originally short vowels in open syllables may be subject to change depending on vowel quality and position of the syllable in the word.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In propretonic syllables all short vowels in open syllables are reduced to vocal \textit{šwa} (or \textit{ḥatef šwa}), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צְדָקָה} \textit{< ṣadaqā} \textit{justice}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲבֹדָה} \textit{ʿibādā} \textit{work.}
		\item In pretonic syllables original /a/ is preserved in disyllabic words before syllables with originally short vowel or syllables with an originally long vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָר} \textit{< *dabar} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלוֺם} \textit{< *šalām}.
		\item Originally short /i/ is preserved in disyllabic words if the next syllable has an originally short vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֵבָב} \textit{< *libab}. If it is a long vowel, originally short /i/ is reduced to \textit{šwa}, e.g. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲמוֺר} \textit{< *ḥimār}.
		\item Originally short /u/ in pretonic syllables is always reduced to \textit{šwa}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רְחוֺב} \textit{< *ruḥāb} \textit{broad open place, plaza}.
		\item If an open syllable with an orginally short vowel is stressed as in some pausal forms of verbs, these vowels are preserved, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמֹ֔רוּ} as opposed to the context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמְרוּ}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item If preserved, originally short vowels have the following forms in Biblical Hebrew according to the Tiberian Masoretic tradition:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The originally short vowel /a/ appears usually either as \textit{qameṣ} or \textit{pataḥ} and at times also as \textit{segol}. If the syllable is stressed, \textit{pataḥ} only occurs in verbal forms; in other forms /a/ becomes \textit{qameṣ} /ā/.
		\item The vowel /i/ appears either as \textit{ḥireq}, \textit{ṣere} or \textit{segol}.
		\item The vowel /u/ appears either as \textit{ḥolem}, \textit{qameṣ ḥaṭuf} or \textit{qibbuṣ}. A \textit{ḥolem} originating from /u/ can only change into \textit{qameṣ ḥaṭuf} or \textit{qibbuṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל} \textit{all of}, with maqqef \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־} \textit{kɔl} \textit{all of}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֹּב} \textit{dōḇ < dubb} \textit{bear}, plural \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֻּבִּים} \textit{dubbīm}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Original short /a/ in an unstressed closed syllable may change to /i/ (law of attenuation), e.g., the proper noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִרְיָם} which is \foreignlanguage{greek}{Μαριαμ} in the LXX.
	\item Original short /i/ in a closed stressed syllable may change to /a/ (Philippi's Law); e.g., \textit{*bint} > \textit{bat} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּת} \textit{daughter}.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Notes}
\nopagebreak

\noindent The law of attenuation and Philippi's law are not laws in the strict sense as there are exceptions to them (cf.\ JM §\,29\textit{aa}). They rather reflect a strong tendency to these vowel changes in defined circumstances.




\section{Inflection of Nouns}
Inflection of nouns happens in the following cases: 

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item change of number from singular to plural or dual
	\item in constructions called construct chains in which two (or more) nouns are joined to express the possessive relation and other relations as in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית הַמֶּלֶךְ} \textit{the house of the king}
	\item the attachment of enclitic personal pronouns (ePP) (also called pronominal suffixes in other grammars) as in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּיתוֺ} \textit{his house}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Gender and Number}
Biblical Hebrew has two categories of gender, masculine (masc.\ or m.) and feminine (fem.\ or f.) and three categories of number, the singular (sg.), the plural (pl.) and for some nouns and uses, the dual (du.).

Masc.\ nouns in the singular are always without an ending whereas fem.\ nouns are often marked as fem.\ by the endings \textit{-ā} or \textit{-t}. A number of fem.\ nouns, though, are not marked as fem.\ by means of a fem.\ ending. An example of a marked fem.\ noun is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִשָּׁה} \textit{woman} with the fem.\ ending; an example of unmarked fem.\ noun is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵם} \textit{mother} without the fem.\ ending.

In Biblical Hebrew the plural is used with most nouns if two or more entities are meant. The dual is restricted to measures of time and space and for body parts that come in pairs. When used for body parts, the dual replaces the plural; it is used even when more than two items are meant.

\subsection{Absolute State and Construct State}
For expressing the possessive relationship as in the noun phrase \textit{the house of the king} Biblical Hebrew uses  a construction called construct chain in which two or more nouns are joined to form a noun phrase. The following two examples illustrate this.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{rl}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קוֺל יַעֲקֹב}	& \textit{Jacob's voice} (Gen 27:22)\\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית הַמֶּלֶךְ}& \textit{the house of the king} (2\,Sam 11:2) \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

\noindent In noun phrases like these, the first noun is in the construct state (cs.\ st.) and the second noun is in the absolute state (abs.\ st.). The first noun is the governing noun (in Latin \textit{nomen regens}) and the second noun is the dependent noun (in Latin \textit{nomen rectum}). When nouns are used independently or with adjectives as attributes or with another noun in apposition, they are in the absolute state. The form in the abs.\ st.\ is also the lexical form (or citation form).

Construct chains form a stress unit. As the first element loses its main stress there is only one syllable in a construct chain carrying the main stress. This results in vowel changes in the noun in the construct state (see below).

Details of the use of the construct state are presented after the explanation of the vowel changes that come with the inflection of nouns.

\subsection{Nominal Endings}
The following nominal endings are found in Biblical Hebrew. They are attached to the adjective \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺב} \textit{good} because the vowel of the adjective is unchangeable and it is attested in all forms mentioned. The endings of the dual forms of nouns with the fem.\ ending \textit{-ā} are illustrated with the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂפָה} \textit{lip, edge} which has changeable vowels. The noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֹאזְנַ֫יִם} \textit{scale, balance} is always used in the dual (because of the two plates or bowls).


\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|ll|lr|lr|}
		\hline
		& & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{masculine} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{feminine}  \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{sg.} & abs. st. & ∅ & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺב} & \textit{-ā} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבָה} \\
		& cs. st. & ∅ & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺב} & \textit{-at} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבַת} \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{pl.} & abs. st. & \textit{-īm} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבִים} & \textit{-ōt} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבוֺת} \\
		& cs. st. &  \textit{-ē}  & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבֵי} & \textit{-ōt} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבוֺת} \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{dual} & abs. st. & \textit{-áyim} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֹאזְנַ֫יִם} & \textit{-ātáyim} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׂפָתַ֫יִם} \\
		& cs. st. & \textit{-ē} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֹאזְנֵי} & \textit{-tē} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׂפְתֵי} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Normally, masc.\ nouns have the plural ending \textit{-īm}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָר} \textit{word}, pl. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּבָרִים}, and fem.\ nouns have the plural ending \textit{-ōt}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּרָכָה} \textit{blessing}, pl. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּרָכוֺת}. There are, however, masc.\ nouns with the plural ending \textit{-ōt}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָקוֺם} \textit{place}, pl. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְקֹמוֺת}, and some fem.\ nouns with the plural ending \textit{-īm}, e.g, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁנָה} \textit{year}, pl. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁנִים}.

Endings distinguish construct state forms from absolute state forms only in nouns with the feminine singular ending \textit{-ā}, plural nouns with the ending \textit{-īm} and masculine and feminine dual nouns. Masculine singular nouns, feminine nouns without ending like \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶרֶץ}, and plural nouns with the ending \textit{-ōt} are not distinguished by their endings from their counterparts in the absolute state.

Beside the distinct endings in some nouns in construct state, construct chains are recognizable by the presence of a dependent noun and the vowel changes in many nouns in construct state as compared to their form in the absolute state.


\subsection{Vowel Changes}
When nouns are used in the plural or dual or in the construct state, vowel changes may happen. With the addition of endings the position of the stress moves. Nouns in a construct chain form a stress unit with the main stress on the stressed syllable of the last noun in the construct chain. As a result vowels in unstressed open syllables of the noun in construct state are subject to change unless they are originally long. The following explanations focus on nouns with changeable vowels.

\subsubsection{Monosyllabic nouns in the singular}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|l|}
		\hline
		& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{abs.\,st.} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cs.\,st.} \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{sg.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּם} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דַּם}} & \textit{blood of} \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֵץ} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֵץ}} & \textit{tree of} \\

		\multirow{2}{*}{pl.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּמִים} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּמֵי}} & \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֵצִים} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲצֵי}} &  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

\subsubsection{Disyllabic nouns}
Masculine nouns have the following forms:

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{Center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
			\hline
			& abs. st. & cs. st. \\
			\hline
			\multirow{3}{*}{sg.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָר} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּבַר} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זָקֵן} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זְקַן} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֵבָב} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְבַב} \\
			\hline
			\multirow{3}{*}{pl.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּבָרִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דִּבְרֵי} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זְקָנִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זִקְנֵי} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲנָבִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִנְּבֵי} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{Center}
\end{table}

\noindent Note: The \textit{dageš} forte in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִנְּבֵי} is secondary and has the purpose of making the \textit{šwa} more audible (cf.\ GKC §\,20h).

\medskip

\noindent As an example of a feminine disyllabic noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צְדָקָה} \textit{righteousness} can be mentioned.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
		\hline
		& abs. st. & cs. st. \\
		\hline
		sg. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צְדָקָה} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צִדְקַת} \\
		\hline
		pl.	& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צְדָקוֺת} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צִדְקוֺת} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

\subsubsection{Segolate nouns}

In the singular, the cs.\ st.\ of segolate nouns is identical to the abs.\ st.\ except in segolate nouns with a semivowel as second root consonant. In the cs.\ st., the original diphthong is contracted to a long vowel. 

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|lr|rl|}
		\hline
		& abs. st. & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cs. st.}  \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{sg.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּיִת} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית} & \textit{house of} \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָוֶת} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מוֺת} & \textit{death of} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

In the plural, segolate nouns use disyllabic bases with two originally short vowels. In the cs.\ st., the original vowel of the first root consonant of the singular form is found (with \textit{ɔ < *u}); the second root consonant has medial \textit{šwa}.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|lr|rl|rl|}
		\hline
		& abs. st. & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cs. st.} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{sg. form} \\
		\hline
		\multirow{3}{*}{pl.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְלָכִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַלְכֵי} & \textit{kings of} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶלֶךְ} & < \textit{*malk} \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁבָטִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁבְטֵי} & \textit{tribes of}  & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֵׁבֶט} & < \textit{*šibṭ} \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֳדָשִׁים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָדְשֵׁי} & \textit{months of}  & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חׂדֶשׁ} & < \textit{*ḥudš} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

In segolate nouns with a semivowel as second root consonant the diphthong (or triphthong) is always contracted in the cs.\ st.\ while in the abs.\ st.\ forms with contraction are attested as well as forms without.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|lr|rl|}
		\hline
		& abs. st. & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cs. st.}  \\
		\hline
		\multirow{3}{*}{pl.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֵיתִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֵיתֵי} & \textit{olive trees of} \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲיָלִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֵילֵי} & \textit{armies of} \\
		& & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מוֺתֵי} & \textit{deaths of} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

\subsubsection{Geminate nouns} 
Geminate nouns are nouns with an originally geminated final consonant that was simplified after the loss of the short final vowel: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַם} \textit{ʿam < ʿamm < ʿammu}. In forms with an ending the gemination of the final consonant is restored.

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{Center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
			\hline
			& abs. st. & cs. st. \\
			\hline
			\multirow{3}{*}{sg.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַם} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַם} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צֵל} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צֵל} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֹּב} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֹּב} \\
			\hline
			\multirow{3}{*}{pl.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַמִּים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַמֵּי} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חִצִּים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חִצֵּי} \\
			& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֻּבִּים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֻּבֵּי}* \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{Center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Nouns ending in \textit{segol-He}}
Nouns with the ending \textit{-ǣ} have the cs.\ st.\ ending \textit{-ē}. The endings of the plural are attached to the last consonant of the noun.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|r|rl|}
		\hline
		& abs.\ st. & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cs.\ st.} \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{sg.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָנֶה} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קְנֵה} & \textit{reed of} \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂדֶה} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׂדֵה} & \textit{field of} \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{pl.} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָנִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קְנֵי} & \\
		& \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂדוֺת} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׂדוֺת} & \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}




\subsection{Construct Chains}

\subsubsection{The Syntax of Construct Chains}
The definiteness of construct chains is determined by the noun in the absolute state, that is the last noun in the construct chain. If it is indefinite, the construct chain is indefinite (Judg 20:40; 1\,Sam 10:3).

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֹאשׁ־חֲמוֺר} & \textit{a head of a donkey} (2\,Kgs 6:25) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פַת־לֶחֶם} & \textit{a morsel of bread} (Gen 18:5) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

If the dependent noun is definite, the entire construct chain becomes definite (Gen 21:17; Gen 32:31). (Nouns are made definite by the definite article, by a enclitic personal pronoun or a definite dependent noun; proper nouns are definite in themselves; cf.\ Chapter 3, Section 8.1). In a construct chain, only the noun in the absolute state may be definite.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קוֹל הַנַּעַר} & \textit{the voice of the boy} (Gen 21:17) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֵׁם הַמָּקוֺם} & \textit{the name of the place} (Gen 32:31) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Note:

\noindent If it needs to be avoided that the entire phrase becomes definite because of a definite noun in it as in \textit{a son of Jesse}, Biblical Hebrew uses constructions with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּן לְיִשַׁי בֵּית הַלַּחְמִי} \textit{a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite} (1\,Sam 16:18).

\bigskip

Construct chains may contain more than two nouns.  If there are more than two nouns in a construct chain, only the last one is in the absolute state. The other nouns in the construct chain are in the construct state.

% The following is probably too complicated and not really necessary: While the first noun in construct state is only a governing noun and the noun in the absolute state at the end is only a dependent noun, the nouns in between are the governing noun of the following dependent noun and, at the same time, the dependent noun of the preceding governing noun in the construct chain.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַב הֲמוֹן גּוֺיִם} & \textit{the father of a multitude of nations} (Gen 17:4) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְמֵי שְׁנֵי חַיֵּי אֲבֹתַי} & \multicolumn{1}{p{0.6\linewidth}}{\textit{the days of the years of the lives of my fathers} (Gen 47:9)} \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קַרְנוֹת מִזְבַּח קְטֹרֶת הַסַּמִּים} & \textit{the horns of the altar of the incense of spices} (Lev 4:7) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

In a construct chain, nouns in the construct state may have two or more dependent nouns (e.g, 1\,Sam 23:7; Num 20:5) although this is often avoided.\footnote{\space Cf.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶל־נְבִיאֵי אָבִיךָ וְאֶל־נְבִיאֵי אִמֶּךָ} \textit{to the prophets of your fathers and to the prophets of your mother} (2\,Kgs 3:13)} On the other hand, a dependent noun may only have one governing noun which means that an English phrase like \textit{the officials and elders of Succoth} needs to be broken up into two noun phrases in Biblical Hebrew (Judg 8:14).

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִיר דְּלָתַיִם וּבְרִיחַ} & \textit{a city with gates and bars} (1\,Sam 23:7) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְקוֹם זֶרַע וּתְאֵנָה וְגֶפֶן וְרִמּוֹן} & \multicolumn{1}{p{0.6\linewidth}}{\textit{a place of seed or figs or vines or pomegranates} (Num 20:5)} \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶת־שָׂרֵי סֻכּוֹת וְאֶת־זְקֵנֶיהָ} & \textit{the officials of Succoth and its elders} (Judg 8:14) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

As a construct chain is a very close unit nothing may separate its nouns, the only exception being the locative He.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּ֫יתָה יוֹסֵף} & \textit{to the house of Joseph} (Gen 43:17) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Attributive adjectives that modify the governing noun of a construct chain and demonstrative pronouns follow the dependent noun at the end of the construct chain.

% Other examples Jer 11:10; 2 Kgs 15:35

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּעַל הַבַּיִת הַזָּקֵן} & \textit{the old owner of the house} (Judg 19:22) \\ %cf. 19:16
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פַּךְ הַשֶּׁמֶן הַזֶּה} & \textit{this flask of oil} (2\,Kgs 9:1) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

In the construct chain \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּעַל הַבַּיִת הַזָּקֵן} in Judg 19:22 the adjective \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זָקֵן} modifies the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּעַל} as shown by the noun phrases \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִישׁ זָקֵן} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִישׁ הַזָּקֵן} in Judg 19:16–17 although it would be grammatically possible to translate the construct chain \textit{the owner of the old house}. In 2\,Kgs 9:1, the antecedent of the demonstrative pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זֶה} is the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פַךְ} and not the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁמֶן} (cf. the differing renderings of the phrase in Vg and LXX).

\subsubsection{The Functions of Construct Chains}
Besides the possessive relation construct chains express a number of different concepts. Important concepts are:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Quality or characteristic

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַר הַקֹֹּדֶשׁ} & \textit{the holy mountain} (lit. \textit{the mountain of holiness}) (Isa 27:13) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱלֹהֵי הַנֵּכָר} & \textit{the foreign gods} (lit. \textit{the gods of foreignness}) (1\,Sam 7:3) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִגְדַּל עֹז} & \textit{a strong tower} (lit. \textit{a tower of strength}) (Judg 9:51) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent The matter out of which something is made, or the content of something

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֶכֶב בַּרְזֶל} & \textit{iron chariots} (Judg 1:19) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְצִיב מֶלַח} & \textit{a pillar of salt} (Gen 19:26) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּקְבֻּק דְּבַשׁ} & \textit{a bottle of honey} (1\,Kgs 14:3) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent If the governing noun expresses a verbal idea, the dependent noun can express the object of the action.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲמַס אָחִיךָ} & \textit{violence against your brother} (Ob 10) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִקְמַת הֵיכָלוֹ} & \textit{vengeance for his temple} (Jer 50:28) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Construct chains can express the partitive idea, i.e., someone or something belonging to a group.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַחַד הָעָם} & \textit{one of the people} (1\,Sam 26:15) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Adjectives can be used in the cs.\ st.\ as normal nouns as in 1\,Sam 16:4 or for expressing various other ideas.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זִקְנֵי הָעִיר} & \textit{the elders of the city} (1\,Sam 16:4) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹרֶף} & \textit{a stiff-necked people} (Exod 32:9) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׂבַע יָמִים} & \textit{full of days} (Gen 35:29) \\ %(lit. \textit{satiate with years})?
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צִחֵה צָמָא} & \textit{parched with thirst} (Isa 5:13) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}


\noindent Although proper nouns are definite in themselves they may occur in special phrases as governing noun in a construct chain.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יהוה צְבָאוֺת} & \textit{the Lord of hosts} (1\,Sam 1:11) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַרְדֵּן יְרִיחוֹ} & \textit{the Jordan at Jericho} (Num 33:48) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּית לֶחֶם יְהוּדָה} & \textit{Bethlehem of Judah} (Judg 19:1)) \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Irregular Nouns in Biblical Hebrew}
A number of nouns have irregular forms in the absolute state in the plural and in the construct state in both the singular and the plural. Most of these nouns are very frequent in the Hebrew Bible. Therefore, familiarity with these forms is important.

\noindent \textbf{Notes}
\nopagebreak
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The asterisk * indicates that the form is not attested in Biblical Hebrew.
	\item More information can be found in P. Joüon and T. Muraoka, \textit{A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew}, §\,98 (abbr.\ JM). Other irregular nouns that are mentioned there, are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָם} \textit{husband’s father,} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָמוֹת}* \textit{husband’s mother,} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׂה} \textit{a head of small livestock}.
	\item The noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָח} \textit{brother} has the following forms with enclitic personal pronoun that need to be mentioned: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶחָ֑י} \textit{my brothers} (pausal form), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶחָיו} \textit{ʾæḥāw} \textit{his brothers.} (with silent /y/)
	\item The plural form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲחָיוֹת} \textit{sisters} is attested in Rabbinic Hebrew but not in Biblical Hebrew.
	\item The \textit{dageš} in the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} in the plural forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּתִּים} \textit{bātīm}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּתֵּי} \textit{bātē}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּתֵּינוּ} \textit{bātēnū} \textit{our houses}, etc.\ is an exceptional \textit{dageš lene} because it is preceded by a full (long) vowel. According to a different explanation, the \textit{dageš} is a \textit{dageš forte}; the forms are then pronounced as \textit{bāttīm}, \textit{bāttē}, \textit{bāttēnū}, etc., with an exceptional \textit{qameṣ gadol} in a closed unstressed syllable.
	\item The nouns \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַ֫יִם} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁמַ֫יִם} are exceptional plural nouns (JM §\,90f, 91f).
\end{enumerate}

% For the plural forms of the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בית} cf. the literature quoted in \textit{HALOT}/Ges18, esp. Brockelmann, GVG I, 430 (§ 229); for the different analysis cf. JM § 98f, Lettinga/von Siegenthal §38, 333 (p. 108).

\section{The Noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל}}
The noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל} can be used as a substantive in the abs.\ st.\ meaning \textit{the whole, entirety, everything}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיהוָה בֵּרַךְ אֶת־אַבְרָהָם בַּכֹּל} \textit{And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things} (Gen 24:1).


It is much more frequently used as the governing noun in construct chains with the cs.\ st.\ forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־}. Used in this way, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל} means \textit{all (of)}, \textit{every} or \textit{any}. Illustrative examples are:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־מָקוֺם} & \textit{every place} (Deut 12:13) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָל־אִישׁ} & \textit{everyone} (lit. \textit{every man} [person]) (Gen 45:1) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־תְּפִלָּה כָל־תְּחִנָּה} & \textit{any prayer, any supplication} (1\, Kgs 8:38) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־מַמְלָכוֹת} & \textit{all kingdoms} (1\,Kgs 10:20) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־הָאָרֶץ} & \textit{all the land, the entire land} (Gen 13:15) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל הָאֲרָצוֹת} & \textit{all the lands} (Gen 41:54) \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

\noindent \textit{Note}

\noindent The particular combination of signs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל} is to be pronounced \textit{kāl} only \emph{once} in the Hebrew Bible in Isa 40:12 (3 m.\ sg.\ suffix conjugation of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כול}). In all other instances \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל} is the cs.\ st. of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּל} and is to be pronounced \textit{kɔl}.



\section{Stem Formations and Conjugations in Biblical Hebrew}
The morphology of the verb in Biblical Hebrew is characterized by a set of \emph{stem formations} (Hebrew \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּנְיָנִים}, singular \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּנְיָן}) and a set of \emph{conjugations} consisting of finite forms expressing tense, aspect and mood and the participle and the two infinitives as non-finite nouns (verbal nouns).

The finite forms with the suffix conjugation, prefix conjugation, jussive, cohortative and imperative are introduced in Chapters 5--7, the non-finite forms with the active and the passive participle and the infinitive construct and infinitive absolute in Chapters 8--9.

The system of the \textit{binyanim} consists of the seven main \textit{binyanim}: Qal, Niphal, Hiphil (with its passive counterpart Hophal), Piel (with its passive and reflexive counterparts Pual and Hitpael, respectively). Compared to the Qal, the other \textit{binyanim} are characterized by prefixes or the gemination of the second root consonant. These additional elements modify the meaning of forms. The following examples illustrate this.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		Qal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָלַךְ} \textit{he reigned as king} & Hiphil \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִמְלִיךְ} \textit{he made (someone) king} \\
		Qal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָבַד} \textit{he perished} & Piel \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִבַּד} \textit{he made (someone) perish} \\
		Qal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָכַר} \textit{he bought} & Niphal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִמְכַּר} \textit{he was sold} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The Qal forms are introduced in Chapters 5--15; the other \textit{binyanim} are introduced beginning in Chapter 16. About 69\,\% of all verbal forms are Qal forms, making this \textit{binyan} most frequent one by far. Hiphil forms are about 13\,\%, Piel forms about 9\,\% and Niphal forms about 6\,\%.


\section{The Suffix Conjugation Qal}

\subsection{The Forms of the Suffix Conjugation Qal}

\noindent The suffix conjugation is characterized by suffixes that are attached to the verbal root at the end. Other terms for the suffix conjugation are \textit{perfect} or in Hebrew \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עבר} (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עָבַר}) \textit{past tense}. As the terms \textit{perfect} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עבר} make implicit statements about the meaning and use of these forms, the term \textit{suffix conjugation} is preferred here because it pertains exclusively to formal features.

In the suffix conjugation Qal, Hebrew makes a formal distinction between fientive or active verbs on the one side and stative verbs on the other side. Fientive verbs are much more frequent than stative verbs. Among the stative verbs, Hebrew distinguishes between verbs with the thematic vowel /e/ and verbs with the thematic vowel /o/. The last category is very infrequent except for the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָכֹל} \textit{to be able to, prevail} with 182 occurrences.

\end{Center}

\bigskip

The suffix conjugation forms include an expression of the subject in the suffixes. An overt subject is grammatically not necessary but frequently present. 

The suffixes can be categorized into three groups: The vocalic suffixes in the 3 f.\  sg.\ and 3 c.\ pl.\ forms consist of only a vowel. These suffixes are stressed in context forms and unstressed in pausal forms. Among the consonantal suffixes -- those that begin with a consonant -- light and heavy consonantal suffixes can be distinguished. Whereas the light suffixes in the 2 m./f.\  sg., 1 c.\ sg.\ and 1 c.\ pl.\ forms are not stressed (except in a certain set of forms), the heavy suffixes in the 2 m./f.\  pl.\ forms are stressed.

Attaching vocalic suffixes or heavy suffixes leads to vowel reduction. In the case of heavy suffixes the first vowel is reduced. When vocalic suffixes are attached, the second vowel is reduced in context forms. In pausal forms the thematic vowel is preserved and stressed, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתָ֑בוּ}.

As examples of distinct pausal forms can be mentioned: 3 m.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתָ֑ב}; forms with vocalic suffix: 3 f.\  sg.\  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתָ֑בָה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּבֵ֑דָה} and 3 c.\ pl.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתָ֑בוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָכֹ֑לוּ}; forms with light suffix with lengthening of the thematic vowel: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתָ֑בְתָּ} etc.

The thematic vowel of static verbs of the type \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּבֵד} changes from /e/ to /a/ in all forms with consonantal suffix.

Sometimes the suffix of the 2 m.\  sg.\ is spelled with a vowel letter: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתַ֫בְתָּה}.

% German Kontaktstellung; JM §42e "the coming-together of results in gemination" (or something like that)

In 2\textsuperscript{nd} person forms and 1 c.\ sg.\ forms of verbs with /t/ as third radical, the /t/ of the root and the initial /t/ of the suffix stand next to each other; the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} is spelled only once and it is doubled, e.g., \textit{kāráttī} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּרַ֫תִּי} \textit{I have cut}.

Although in forms of verbs with /n/ as third radical the /n/ is immediately followed by the consonant /t/ in all forms with consonantal suffix except the 1 c.\ pl.\ forms, the /n/ of the root is \textit{not} assimilated to the following /t/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁכַ֫נְתִּי} \textit{I dwelt}. An exception is the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָתַ֫תִּי} < \textit{nātantī} \textit{I gave}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְתַתֶּם} < \textit{nətantæm} \textit{you gave}. %LvS 496

In 1 c.\ pl.\ forms of verbs with /n/ as third radical (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן}) the /n/ of the root and the initial /n/ of the suffix \textit{-nū} stand next to each other; the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נ} is spelled only once and it is doubled, e.g., \textit{nātánnū} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָתַ֫נּוּ} \textit{we gave}.

The original forms of the suffixes may have bearing on verbal forms with enclitic personal pronouns. The zero morpheme of the 3 m.\  sg.\ form originates from the loss of a short final vowel *\textit{kataba > kātab} without an ending. The original forms of the suffixes of the 3 f.\  sg.\ and 2 m./f.\  sg.\ need to be mentioned here, too.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{lllr}
		3 m. sg. & \textit{-a} > ∅ &  \textit{*kataba > kātaḇ} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתַב} \\
		3 f. sg. & \textit{-at} > \textit{-ā} &  \textit{*katabat > kātǝḇā} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבָה} \\
		2 m. sg. & \textit{-ta} > \textit{-tā} &  \textit{*katabta > kātáḇtā} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתַ֫בְתָּ} \\

	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}

\subsection{The Suffix Conjugation Qal of Guttural Verbs}

\noindent Suffix conjugation forms of guttural verbs are characterized by only few differences in comparison with the verbs without gutturals. In verbs I gutt.\ and II gutt.\ the vocal \textit{šwa} is replaced by \textit{ḥatef pataḥ} in the 3 f.\  sg.\ and 3 c.\ pl.\ and the 2 m./f.\  pl., respectively. In verbs III gutt., the consonant cluster in the 2 f.\  sg.\ form is broken up by insertion of a vowel. The \textit{dageš lene} in the /t/ of the suffix that is found in the verbal forms without guttural is retained.

\begin{Center}
	\begin{tabular}{llrrr}
		& & I gutt. & II gutt. & III gutt. \\
		sg. & 3 f. & & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּחֲרָה} & \\
		& 2 f. & & & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלַ֫חַתְּ} \\
		pl. & 3 c. & & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּחֲרוּ} & \\
		& 2 m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲזַבְתֶּם} & & \\
		& 2 f. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲזַבְתֶּן} & & \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{Center}


\subsection{The Use of the Suffix Conjugation}
The use of the suffix conjugation and how it is translated depends on the verb type. Suffix conjugations forms of fientive verbs have different translation options than the same forms of stative verbs.

\subsubsection{Fientive verbs}

The suffix conjugation is used for events in the past.
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַיִם שָׁאַל חָלָב נָתָ֫נָה} & \textit{He asked for water, she gave} [him] \textit{milk.} (Judg 5:25) \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip
\noindent Sometimes the past event has bearing on the present. Then the present perfect should be used in the English translation.
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִנֵּה נָתַן יְהוָה עֲלֵיכֶם מֶלֶךְ} & \textit{... and see, the Lord has set a king over you.} (1\,Sam 12:13) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָרַע יְהוָה אֶת־מַמְלְכוּת יִשְׂרָאֵל מֵעָלֶיךָ הַיּוֹם} & \textit{The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today.} (1 Sam 15:28) \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip
\noindent In narratives the suffix conjugation is used instead of the \textit{wayyiqṭol} form when a constituent is fronted (often for emphasis or contrast).
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָעִיר שָׂרְפוּ בָאֵשׁ} & \textit{And the city they burnt with fire.} (Jos 6:24) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְאֶת־בְּנוֹתֵיהֶם נָתְנוּ לִבְנֵיהֶם} & \textit{... and their daughters they gave to their sons.} (Judg 3:6) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְצֵידָה נָתַן לוֹ} & \textit{... and he gave him provisions.} (1 Sam 22:10) \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip
\noindent The suffix conjugation is used for anterior events (in a past tense context the pluperfect is used in English).

\subsubsection{Stative verbs}

Suffix conjugation forms of stative verbs refer to states in the present. This applies also to verbs of mental perception (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ידע} Q. \textit{to know}) and verbs that express emotions (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אהב} Q. \textit{to love}).

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַל־כֵּן גָּדַלְתָּ  אֲדֹנָי יְהוִה} & \textit{Therefore you are great, O Lord GOD} (2\,Sam 7:22) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָטֹנְתִּי מִכֹּל הַחֲסָדִים} & \textit{I am too insignificant for all your kindness} (Gen 32:11) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא יָדַעְתִּי  מִי עָשָׂה אֶת־הַדָּבָר הַזֶּה} & \textit{I do not know who did this thing} (Gen 21:26) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָהַבְתִּי אֶת־אֲדֹנִי אֶת־אִשְׁתִּי וְאֶת־בָּנָי} & \textit{I love my lord and my wife and my children} (Exod 21:5) \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Suffix conjugation forms of stative verbs can also express a state in the past or the entrance into a state in the past.

	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי יָגֹרְתִּי מִפְּנֵי הָאַף וְהַחֵמָה אֲשֶׁר קָצַף יְהוָה עֲלֵיכֶם}
		& \textit{For I was afraid of the anger and wrath that the LORD had against you.} (Deut 9:19) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּוָּעַץ אֶת־הַיְלָדִים אֲשֶׁר גָּדְלוּ אִתּוֹ} & \textit{And he exchanged counsel with the young men that had grown up with him.} [= that had become grown-up with him] (1\,Kgs 12:8) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent The suffix conjugation has other functions that do not need to be introduced here.
	
	\subsection{Subject Expression and Agreement}
	As explained above, the suffix conjugation forms include an expression of the subject in the suffixes marking the forms for person, gender and number. An overt subject is grammatically not necessary but frequently present. If an overt subject is present, it agrees with the verbal form in gender and number. In Gen 13:12 the verb and the subject are in the singular; in Judg 3:5 they are both in the plural.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַבְרָם יָשַׁב בְּאֶֽרֶץ־כְּנָעַן וְלוֹט יָשַׁב בְּעָרֵי הַכִּכָּר} & \textit{Abram settled in the land of Canaan while Lot settled in the cities in the vicinity [of the Jordan]} (Gen 13:12) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל יָשְׁבוּ בְּקֶרֶב הַכְּנַעֲנִי} & \textit{So the Isrealites settled among the Canaanites} (Judg 3:5) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	While agreement is the norm, lack of agreement does occur, especially when the verb is at the beginning of the clause and followed by a compound subject consisting of more than one entity.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּבֹא מֹשֶׁה וְאַהֲרֹן אֶל־פַּרְעֹה} & \textit{Moses and Aaron came to Pharao} (Exod 7:10) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	With 1st and 2nd person verbal forms only independent personal pronouns may be used as overt subjects. They agree with the verbal form in person, number and gender.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנִי שָׁמָ֑עְתִּי} & \textit{I have heard [it]} (Ezek 35:13) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The rules for agreement and the expression for the subject apply to the other finite verbal forms, as well, i.e., the prefix conjugation, the volitive forms jussive, cohortative and imperative, and the \textit{wayyiqṭol} and \textit{wɔqaṭaltí} forms.
	
	Other terms for \textit{agreement} and \textit{lack of agreement} are \textit{congruency} and \textit{incongruency}.
	
	
	\section{The Negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא}}
	The most common negative in Biblical Hebrew is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} \textit{lō(ʾ)} \textit{not} (with silent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}). It is used with verbal forms (except infinitives) as negation of the entire clause. The negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} is usually placed immediately before the verbal form, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא צָחַקְתִּי} \textit{I have not laughed} (Gen 18:15).
	
	The negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} is also used as the negative answer \textit{no} to a yes-no question, request or statement (e.g., Gen 23:11; 1\,Sam 1:15).
	
	It can be used to negate a single word as in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֶּרֶךְ לֹא־טוֹב} \textit{a way not good} (Ps 36:5), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּן לֹא חָכָם} \textit{an unwise son} (Hos 13:13), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְלֹא־אֵל} \textit{with a not-God} (Deut 32:21).

	\section{Prefix Conjugation Qal}
	
	\subsection{The forms of the Prefix Conjugation}
	
	The prefix conjugation is characterized by prefixes in all forms of the paradigm. In some forms suffixes are attached to the form as well.
	
	In the prefix conjugation Biblical Hebrew distinguishes two forms with different thematic vowels, i.e., the vowels between the second and third root consonants. The form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִקְטֹל} \textit{yiqṭōl} with the thematic vowel /ō/ is used for fientive verbs while the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכְבַּד} \textit{yikbad} with the thematic vowel /a/ is used for stative verbs.
	
	For a proper understanding of the forms of the prefix conjugation forms of verbs with gutturals and some weak verbs it is important to note that the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִקְטֹל} \textit{yiqṭol} is the result of the development \textit{*yaqṭulu > yiqṭol} (with loss of the final short vowel as usual in BH).\footnote{\space The original vowels are preserved in Classical Arabic, e.g., \textit{yafʿulu} \textit{he will do}. The forms of the prefix conjugation forms of verbs I\,ʾ, II\,\textit{w/y} and II\,gem.\ can only be explained with the original forms with the vowel /a/ in the prefix.}  The change of the prefix vowel /a/ > /i/ is due to the law of attenuation (/a/ > /i/ in unstressed closed syllables). The change of /u/ > /ō/ in stressed syllables is regular.
	
	The prefix vowel /i/ and thematic vowel /a/ of the forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכְבַּד} \textit{yikbad}, etc., of the stative verb are the original vowels; they were not subject to change.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The vowel /æ/ in the prefix of the 1 c.\ sg.\ form needs to be noted. The consonant /ʾ/ often triggers the change of a vowel to /æ/.
	
	The forms with stressed vocalic suffix (2\ f.\ sg.\ and 3/2\ m.\ pl.) have distinct pausal forms. The stress is on the penultimate syllable and the original thematic vowel is preserved instead of being reduced as in the context forms: e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכְתֹּ֑בוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכְבָּ֑דוּ}.
	
	In forms with /a/ as thematic vowel the \textit{pataḥ} is lengthened to \textit{qameṣ} in pausal forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכְבָּ֑ד}.
	
	The forms 3/2m.\ pl.\ are quite often extended by an additional \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ן} called paragogic Nun, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּשְׁמְרוּן} \textit{you shall keep} (Deut 6:17),  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמְעוּן} \textit{they will hear} (Deut 4:6). Most of the 305 examples in the Hebrew Bible are found in Deut, Isa, Job and Ps 104 (JM §\,44e). There is no difference in meaning between the normal forms and the forms with paragogic Nun. In pausal forms the thematic vowel is preserved despite the position of the stress, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּכְרֹת֑וּן} \textit{you shall cut down} (Exod 34:13), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּדְבָּק֑וּן} \textit{you shall cling} (Deut 13:5). Sometimes pausal forms with paragogic Nun are found in context. In five cases 2 f.\ sg.\ forms also have a paragogic Nun, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּדְבָּקִין} \textit{you shall cling} (Ruth 2:8).
	
	The possible confusion of identical forms (3 f.\ sg.\ and 2 m.\ sg.\ forms and 3/2 fem.\ pl.) is hardly ever an issue in Biblical Hebrew texts.
	
\subsection{Historical Background}
In the earliest phase of Northwest Semitic the prefix conjugation had four distinct forms. Two forms had a short final vowel: \textit{yaqṭulu} and \textit{yaqṭula}. The form \textit{yaqṭulu} functioned as an indicative form while the form \textit{yaqṭula} was used as a subjunctive. Vestiges of the form \textit{yaqṭula} can still be found in the cohortative and the long form of the imperative.
	
The third form was a short form without a final vowel \textit{yaqṭul} which functioned either as a perfective past tense (or preterite) or as a volitive form. This form is preserved in the \textit{wayyiqṭol} form and the jussive in Biblical Hebrew.
	
Because of the general loss of short final vowels the formal difference between the forms \textit{yaqṭulu} and \textit{yaqṭul} is lost in most forms. It is reflected only in some volitive forms and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms of certain classes of weak verbs and in some Hiphil forms.
	
A fourth form was the so-called energic mode \textit{yaqṭulan(na)} which is preserved only in some forms of the prefix conjugation with enclitic personal pronouns.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The gutturals  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה},  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} and  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} prefer the vowel /a/ in the positions before and after the guttural. There are, however, some I\,gutt.\ verbs with \textit{yaqṭul} prefix conjugation forms that have the prefix vowel /æ/ instead of /a/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶהְדֹּף} \textit{he will push}. When the guttural \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is preserved as a consonant, the vowel /æ/ is preferred, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶאְסֹר} \textit{he will bind}.
	
	Many I\,gutt.\ verbs have a \textit{ḥatef} vowel with the first root consonant instead of silent \textit{šwa} (cp.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעֲזֹב} with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכְתֹּב}) while other I\,gutt.\ verbs tolerate the silent \textit{šwa} (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַחְמֹד} \textit{he shall desire}).
	
	In context forms with vocalic suffix (2 f.\ sg.\ and 2/3 m.\ pl.) of I\,gutt.\ verbs the two consecutive vocal \textit{šwa} are changed to a closed syllable with the vowel of the preceding vowel and medial \textit{šwa} which does not trigger a \textit{dageš lene} in the following consonant, e.g., \textit{*taʿăzǝḇū > taʿazḇū} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תַּעַזְבוּ} and \textit{*yæḥæ̆zǝqū > yæḥæzqū} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶחֶזְקוּ}. In forms like these Biblical Hebrew tolerates short vowels in open syllables.
	
	Fientive verbs I\,gutt.\ have the vowel pattern \textit{a--u} with preservation of the original vowel of the prefixes while stative verbs I\,gutt.\ have the vowel pattern \textit{i--a} (with change of the /i/ to /æ/ to bring the prefix vowel closer to the vowel /a/ that is preferred by gutturals).
	
	Verbs II\,gutt.\ usually have the vowel pattern \textit{i--a} irrespective of their semantic classification as fientive or stative. The stem vowel /ō/ can be found with a few verbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶאֱחֹז} \textit{he shall grasp}. Verbs III\,gutt.\ almost always show the vowel pattern \textit{i--a}.
	
	In pausal forms with vocalic suffix the original thematic vowel is preserved and the stress is on the penultimate syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעֲזֹ֑בוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּשְׁלָ֑חוּ}.
	
	In forms with /a/ as thematic vowel the \textit{pataḥ} is lengthened to \textit{qameṣ} in pausal forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִבְחָ֑ר}.
	
	
	\subsection{The Use of the Prefix Conjugation}
	
	\noindent The prefix conjugation has three main uses:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item as a future tense and -- almost exclusively occurring in questions and subordinate clauses -- present tense (1\,Sam 9:16; Gen 24:31)
		\item as a form expressing imperfective aspect in the past for durative or iterative (repeated) past-time events (1\,Kgs 17:6)
		\item as a modal form expressing obligation, capability etc.\ (expressed in English with auxiliary verbs like \textit{may, would, shall, can, must, want, could, should}, etc.), e.g., Exod 20:9; Deut 23:7. With the negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} the prefix conjugation is used for general or strict prohibitions (e.g., Exod 20:15). This use is called vetitive and forms a subgroup of the modal use of the prefix conjugation.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{The \textit{wayyiqṭol} Form}
	The \textit{wayyiqṭol} form is a past tense form that is based on the short form of the prefix conjugation \textit{yaqṭul} in its function as perfective past tense. It is formed by a special form of the conjunction \textit{waw} with \textit{pataḥ} und \textit{dageš forte} in the consonant of the prefix syllable. As the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} of the 1 c.\ sg.\ prefix does not take \textit{dageš forte} the vowel is changed to \textit{qameṣ}.
	
	This special form of the conjunction is called \textit{waw consecutive} (sometimes called \textit{waw inversive} [Hebrew \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָו הַהִפּוּךְ}] although this term is rather misleading and historically incorrect). In the strong verb, the actual form of the \textit{wayyiqṭol} form is identical with the normal prefix conjugation. This applies to pausal forms as well. Only with weak verbs and in derived conjugations deviating forms occur.

	\end{center}
	
	
	The \textit{wayyiqṭol} form is used as a past tense form, e.g., Exod 24:4. Chains of \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms form the backbone of narratives. \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms need to be in clause initial position.\footnote{\space Whenever another element needs to be placed in clause initial position (e.g., the negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא}), different verbal forms need to be used.} With stative verbs the \textit{wayyiqṭol} form usually has ingressive meaning, i.e., \textit{began to $\ldots$}, e.g., Gen 41:56.

	\section{Volitive Forms}
	
	\subsection{Introduction}
	Volitive forms are verbal forms that express an intention or desire. Biblical Hebrew has three volitive forms, the cohortative (1st person), the imperative (2nd person) and the jussive (2nd and 3rd person). The most frequent volitive form is the imperative which is introduced in Chapter 7.
	
	\subsection{The Jussive}
	The jussive is a volitive form that can be used in the 3rd or 2nd person. Historically, the jussive is based on the short form of the prefix conjugation \textit{yaqṭul}. The jussive forms of strong verbs are identical to the prefix conjugation forms discussed above. Only weak verbs of the types III\,\textit{y} and II\,\textit{w/y} have distinct jussive forms in the Qal.
	
	The jussive is used for commands, instructions, requests and petitions in the 3rd person and in the 2nd person. It is used both in positive and negative clauses. With negative commands, the negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַל} is used. Positive clauses with the 2nd person jussive forms as predicate, however, are very infrequent.
	
	\medskip
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁפֹּט יְהוָה בֵּינִי וּבֵינֶ֫ךָ} & \textit{Let the Lord judge between me and you.} (Gen 16:5) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָבֹא־נָא אֵלַי} & \textit{Let him come to me.} (2 Kgs 5:8) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַל־תִּשְׁלַח יָדְךָ אֶל־הַנַּעַר} & \textit{Do not lay your hand on the boy.} (Gen 22:12) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\subsection{The Cohortative}
	
	\noindent The cohortative -- the first person volitive form -- is used for exhortations, requests, wishes, or declarations of intent. It is marked by the ending \textit{-ā} that is attached to the 1 c.\ sg./pl.\ prefix conjugation form. The thematic vowel is reduced in context forms as the ending is stressed.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|ll|r|}

			\hline
			pl. & 1 c. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִכְתְּבָה} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\noindent In pausal forms the thematic vowel is preserved and stressed: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶכְתֹּ֫בָה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִכְתֹּ֫בָה}
	
	\medskip
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְאֶקְבְּרָה אֶת־אָבִי} & \textit{and let me bury my father.} (Gen 50:5) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָ֫בָה נִלְבְּנָה לְבֵנִים} & \textit{Come now, let us make bricks.} (Gen 11:3) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\section{The Marker of Subordination \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר}}
	The word \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} serves as a marker of subordination introducing dependent clauses among which relative clauses are the most frequent. Because of this, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} is sometimes called relative particle.
	
	\subsection{Relative Clauses}
	Relative clauses can either function as dependent attributive clauses modifying a noun or be substantivized replacing a noun. Unlike the relative pronouns \textit{which} and \textit{that} in English or \foreignlanguage{greek}{ ὅς, ἥ, ὅ } etc. in Greek, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} is not a relative pronoun in the sense that it is a constituent of the relative clause. It rather functions as a marker of subordination. As a consequence, one often finds in the relative clause a resumptive pronoun or adverb which refers back to the antecedent. If the resumptive pronoun would be the direct object of the predicate of the relative clause, it is usually dropped because it can be easily retrieved from the immediate context.\footnote{\space An example of an resumptive pronominal element as direct object is found in 2\,Kgs 16:3 \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתֹעֲבוֹת הַגּוֹיִם אֲשֶׁר הוֹרִישׁ יְהוָה אֹתָם מִפְּנֵי בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל} \textit{according to the abominations of the peoples that the Lord had driven out before the Israelites}.} Other resumptive elements (e.g., prepositional phrases) may be dropped, too.
	
	If the relative clause serves as attribute to a noun, it is possible to first render \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} as \textit{about which can be said} and translate the relative clause as if it were an independent clause. In the next step, the relative clause can be integrated smoothly into the main clause.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן־הַמָּקוֹם אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּה שָׁם} & \textit{from the place about which can be said: you are there} > \textit{from the place where you are} (Gen 13:14) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	In the overview below it is indicated which element is dropped from the relative clause.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַיֵּה הָאֲנָשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֫אוּ אֵלֶ֫יךָ הַלָּ֫יְלָה} & \textit{Where are the men who came to you tonight?} (Gen 19:5) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקְרָא אַבְרָם שֶׁם־בְּנוֹ אֲשֶׁר־יָלְדָה הָגָר יִשְׁמָעֵאל} & \textit{And Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore, Ishmael} (Gen 16:15; direct object) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַל־הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּר אֵלָיו נָבוֹת הַיִּזְרְעֵאלִי} & \textit{\dots \space because of the word that Naboth, the Jezreelite, had said to him} (1\,Kgs 21:4; direct object) \\

	\end{longtable}
	
	\noindent The following two clauses contain substantivized clauses with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} as subject (Gen 38:10) and direct object (Exod 18:1; Exod 11:7 where \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} is equivalent to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי}), respectively.

	\noindent Substantivized clauses with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} may also be dependent on a preposition.

	\section{The Independent Personal Pronoun}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Independent Personal Pronoun}
	The independent personal pronoun (iPP) has the following forms:
	
	\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.4}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|ll|r|l|ll|r|l|}
			\hline
			\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Singular} & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Plural} \\
			\hline
			1 & c. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנִי} ,\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹכִי} & \textit{I}  & 1 & c. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נַ֫חְנוּ} ,\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנַ֫חְנוּ} & \textit{we}\\

			\hline
		\end{tabular}	
	\end{center}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Notes about the Forms of the Independent Personal Pronoun}
	
	% Examples: 1 Sam 24:9
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item The following pausal forms are attested (some of them have a different position of the stress than the context forms): 1 c.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹ֑כִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֑נִי}; 2 m.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֑תָּה} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַ֔תָּה} (with \textit{zāqēf qāṭōn}); 2 f.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֑תְּ}; 1 c.\ pl.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנָ֑חְנוּ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָ֑חְנוּ}.
		\item In the Torah, the personal pronoun of the 3 f.\ sg.\ is spelled \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוא} in the Ketiv with the Qere perpetuum \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִיא} in almost all instances. For more information cf.\ Joüon and Muraoka, \textit{A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew}, §§\,16f, 39c.
		\item The existence of two different pronouns for the 1 c.\ sg.\ is remarkable. The form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנִי} is more frequent than the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹכִי} (874 and 359 attestations, respectively). The longer form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹכִי} was phased out in Late Biblical Hebrew. Mishnaic Hebrew only uses \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנִי}.
		\item The 2 m.\ sg.\ form is five times spelled \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתָּ}.
		\item Rare alternative forms are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתְּ} for the 2 m.\ sg.\ (four times); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתִּי}* for the 2 f.\ sg.\ (seven times as Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אתי}); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנוּ}* for the 1 c.\ pl.\ (as in Mishnaic Hebrew; only in Jer 42:6 Ketiv).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{The Use of the iPP in Nominal Clauses}
	In nominal clauses the iPP may be used in the following ways.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item The independent personal pronoun is used as the subject in nominal clauses (2 Sam 12:7).
		\item The independent personal pronoun is used as subject in clauses with a participle as predicate (1\,Sam 17:45).
		\item The 3 m.\ sg.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּא} may be used in verbless clauses to disambiguate the preceding subject and the predicate (2\,Sam 7:28).
		\item As subject of a nominal clause, the independent personal pronoun may be used similarly to the demonstrative pronoun (2\,Kgs 15:12; Lev 10:3).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתָּה הָאִישׁ} & \textit{You are the man} (2 Sam 12:7) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתָּה בָּא אֵלַי בְּחֶרֶב וּבַחֲנִית וּבְכִידוֹן וְאָנֹכִי בָא־אֵלֶיךָ בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת אֱלֹהֵי מַעַרְכוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל} & \textit{You are coming to me with a sword, with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel} (1\,Sam 17:45) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתָּה־הוּא הָאֱלֹהִים} & \textit{You are God} (2\,Sam 7:28) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּא דְבַר־יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר אֶל־יֵהוּא} & \textit{This is the word of the Lord that he had spoken to Jehu} (2\,Kgs 15:12) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּא אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּר יְהוָה} & \textit{This is what the Lord has said~\dots} (Lev 10:3) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\subsection{The Use of the iPP in Verbal Clauses}
	The independent personal pronoun is used as the subject in clauses with finite verbal forms as predicate (often for emphasis of the subject):
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי אַתָּה יָדַעְתָּ לְבַדְּךָ אֶת־לְבַב כָּל־בְּנֵי הָאָדָם} & \textit{For \emph{you} alone know the heart of all children of mankind} (1\,Kgs 8:39) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	
	\subsection{The iPP as Demonstrative Pronoun}
	As attribute to a noun the 3rd person forms may be used as demonstrative pronouns for far deixis. The independent personal pronoun in this function follows the noun it modifies and always has the article.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִישׁ הַהוּא} & \textit{that man} (Lev 20:4) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָעִיר הַהִיא} & \textit{that city} (Josh 20:4) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאֲנָשִׁים הָהֵמָּה} & \textit{those men} (Num 9:7) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	This use of the iPP is frequently found in the temporal adverbial phrases \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא} \textit{on that day} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם} \textit{in those days}.
	
	\subsection{The iPP in Apposition to an Enclitic Pronoun}
	The independent personal pronoun may be used in apposition to an enclitic personal pronoun for emphasis:   
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּרֲכֵנִי גַם־אָנִי אָבִי} & \textit{Bless me, too, O my father} (Gen 27:34) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּמְקוֹם אֲשֶׁר לָקְקוּ הַכְּלָבִים אֶת־דַּם נָבוֹת יָלֹקּוּ הַכְּלָבִים אֶת־דָּמְךָ גַּם־אָֽתָּה} &  \textit{In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth the dogs will lick even your blood} (1\,Kgs 21:19) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	
	
	\section{Nominal Clauses}
	Clauses without a finite verbal form as predicate are called nominal clauses. The subject is typically a noun or pronoun. Predicates can be nouns, adjectives or prepositional phrases.
	
	If the predicate is indefinite, the nominal clause has descriptive or classifying function.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נַעַר מִצְרִי אָנֹכִי} & \textit{I am a young man from Egypt} (1\,Sam 30:13) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָרָה אָנֹכִי} & \textit{I am pregnant} (2\,Sam 11:5) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	
	If the predicate is definite, the nominal clause has identifying function.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנִי יוֹסֵף} & \textit{I am Joseph} (Gen 45:3) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹכִי הָרֹאֶה} & \textit{I am the seer} (1 Sam 9:19) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָנֹכִי אֱלֹהֵי אַבְרָהָם אָבִיךָ} & \textit{I am the God of Abraham, your father} (Gen. 26:24) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Prepositional phrases can also function as predicate of a nominal clause.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִנֵּה אָנֹכִי עִמָּךְ} & \textit{Behold, I am with you} (Gen 28:15) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵחָרָן אֲנָחְנוּ} & \textit{We are from Haran} (Gen 29:4) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The most common unmarked constituent order of nominal clauses is subject--predicate. The reasons for deviating from this constituent order are diverse.
	
	% Here, additional information is needed.
	
	Nominal clauses are timeless. The default location in time is the present. In a past tense context, however, nominal clauses are located in the past. To make past or future reference explicit, forms of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} \textit{to be} are used. Temporal adverbs may serve the same function, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּמָחָר אַתָּה וּבָנֶיךָ עִמִּי} \textit{and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me} (1\,Sam 28:19).
	
	As an additional element, the independent personal pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּא} may be used in nominal clauses. Different explanations were presented for this use of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּא}. It possibly functions to disambiguate the preceding subject and the predicate.
	
	% This explanation is taken from BHRG S. 293 (§36.1.1.2.4).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַתָּה־הוּא הָאֱלֹהִים} & \textit{You are God} (2\,Sam 7:28) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	
	
	\section{Adjectives}
	
	\subsection{The Use of the Adjective}
	Adjectives are a subcategory of the noun. Adjectives have have three different functions in Hebrew:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item As attribute they modify (describe) a noun (2\,Sam 14:2).
		\item They can be used independently like other nouns (the so-called substantivized use) (Qoh 2:14).
		\item They can be used as the predicate of a nominal clause (Jer 8:8).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקַּח מִשָּׁם אִשָּׁה חֲכָמָה} & \textit{And he took from there a wise woman} (2\,Sam 14:2) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי כְּהֶחָכָם} & \textit{Who is like the wise?} (Qoh 8:1) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲכָמִים אֲנַחְנוּ} & \textit{We are wise} (Jer 8:8) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Adjective phrases can be expanded with the degree particle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְאֹד} \textit{very}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִישׁ חָכָם מְאֹד} \textit{a very wise man} (2\,Sam 13:3). Sometimes, the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַד} \textit{up to, until} is added, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲרָדָה גְּדֹלָה עַד־מְאֹד} \textit{a very strong trembling} (Gen 27:33). Originally, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְאֹד} is a noun meaning \textit{strength, power}.
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Adjective}
	As a subcategory of the noun, adjectives have the same endings except for the fact that they are not used in the dual. Adjectives with changeable vowels follow the rules for vowel reduction for nouns (Chapter 4).
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|lr|lr|}
			\hline
			& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Masculine} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Feminine}\\
			\hline
			Singular & ∅ & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺב} & \textit{-ā} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבָה} \\
			Plural & \textit{-īm} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבִים} & \textit{-ōt} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֺבוֺת} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Adjectives as Attribute or Predicate}
	If used as attribute, adjectives follow the noun they modify and must agree in number and gender with the noun. If the modified noun is definite, the adjective takes the article. The following examples illustrate this.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִישׁ גָּדוֹל} & \textit{a great man} (2\,Kgs 5:1) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְלָכִים גְּדוֹלִים} & \textit{great kings} (Jer 25.14) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִשָּׁה גְדוֹלָה} & \textit{a wealthy woman} (2\,Kgs 4:8) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַמְלָכוֹת גְּדֹלוֹת} & \textit{great kingdoms} (Jer 28:8) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַיָּם הַגָּדוֹל} & \textit{the great sea} (i.e., the Mediterranean Sea) (Josh 23:4) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַבְּרֵכָה הָעֶלְיוֹנָה} & \textit{the upper pool} (2\,Kgs 18:17) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶהָרִים הַגְּבֹהִים} & \textit{the high mountains} (Gen 7:19) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאֹתוֹת הַגְּדֹלוֹת} & \textit{the great signs} (Josh 24:17) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Note}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent Agreement is also required in the case of fem.\ nouns without a fem.\ ending, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָעִיר הַגְּדֹלָה} \textit{the great city} (Gen 10:12).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	If used as predicate of nominal clauses (see the preceding section), adjectives agree with the subject in gender and number.
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוֹבָה הָאָרֶץ מְאֹד מְאֹד} & \textit{The land is exceedingly good} (Num 14:7) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
\subsection{Comparative and Superlative}
Unlike English or Greek, Hebrew does not have distinct forms to express the comparative (e.g., \textit{higher}) or the superlative (e.g., \textit{highest}). For the comparative, a prepositional phrase with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} is used to indicate the entity with which something is compared; the adjective itself remains unchanged. This is illustrated by the following examples with the adjectives \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָתוֺק} \textit{sweet} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צַדִּיק} \textit{righteous}
	
\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה־מָּתוֹק מִדְּבַשׁ וּמֶה עַז מֵאֲרִי} & \textit{What is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion?} (Judg 14:18) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צַדִּיק אַתָּה מִמֶּנִּי} & \textit{You are more righteous than I} (1\,Sam 24:18) \\
\end{longtable}
	
For the superlative, the adjective is used with the definite article or it is made definite by other means, e.g., a definite dependent noun in a construct chain. 
	
\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָעִיר הַקְּרֹבָה אֶל־הֶחָלָל} & \textit{the town that is nearest to the slain man} (Deut 21:3) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְהוֹאָחָז קְטֹן בָּנָיו} & \textit{Jehoahaz, his youngest son} (2\,Chr 21:17) \\
\end{longtable}
	
If the two entities that are compared are incommensurable, the particle \textit{too} together with a prepositional phrase with \textit{for} may be used in English.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קוּם אֱכֹל כִּי רַב מִמְּךָ הַדָּרֶךְ} & \textit{Get up, eat, for the journey is too much for you} (1\,Kgs 19:7) \\

	\noindent The thematic vowel of the imperative form of a verb is identical to the thematic vowel of the \textit{yiqṭol} form of that verb.
	
	There is no \textit{dageš lene} in the third root consonant in the fem.\ sg.\ and masc.\ pl.\ forms. The \textit{šwa} with the second root consonant it a medial \textit{šwa}.
	
	Pausal forms of the fem.\ sg.\ and masc.\ pl.\ forms have the same thematic vowel as the masc.\ sg.\ form, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתֹ֑בִי}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתֹ֑בוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּבָ֑דוּ}.
	
	If the imperative is followed by \textit{maqqef}, the thematic vowel \textit{ḥolem} is shortened to \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְלָךְ־עָלֵ֫ינוּ} \textit{Reign over us!} (Judg 9:14).
	
	% Other examples: 1 Sam 11:1; Exod 34:1; Exod 34:4; Exod 34:27
	
	An example of an imperative form of a stative verb is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲזַק} \textit{be strong!} (Josh 1:6). The pausal form of the m. sg. imperative of the stative verb has a lengthened thematic vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱמָ֑ץ} \textit{be bold!} (Josh 1:6).

	\noindent Like the regular verb, verbs I gutt.\ and I\,ʾ distinguish between fientive and stative verbs. An example of an imperative form of a I\,ʾ stative verb is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱמַץ} \textit{be bold!} (Josh 1:7).
	
	Imperative forms of verbs with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} as first root consonant are always strong with a consonantal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} (unlike the weak verbs I\,\textit{ʾ} in the prefix conjugation forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֹאמַר}). The thematic vowel is either \textit{ḥolem} or \textit{pataḥ} depending on the verb type as fientive or stative, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱמֹר} \textit{say!}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱמַץ} \textit{be bold!}
	
	In the fem.\ sg.\ and masc.\ pl.\ forms, II gutt. verbs have the vowel \textit{pataḥ} with the first root consonant and a composite \textit{šwa} (\textit{ḥaṭef pataḥ}) with the second root consonant instead of a silent \textit{šwa}.
	
	\subsection{The Long Form of the Imperative}
	
	The imperative masc.\ sg.\ may be expanded by attaching the ending \textit{-ā}. This ending is called paragogic \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}. It occurs about 288 times in the Hebrew Bible. It \enquote{has, in general, no appreciable different nuance from the usual form} (JM §\,114m). Illustrative forms are: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָכְלָה} \textit{ʾɔḵlā} \textit{eat!} (sometimes \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִכְרָה} \textit{sell!}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁמְעָה} \textit{hear!} (III gutt.).
	
	% Weak verbs: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גְּשָׂה} (I\,n), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּנָה} (I\,n), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁבָה} (I\,y), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק֫וּמָה} (II\,w), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׂ֫ימָה} (II\,)
	
	In pausal forms the ending \textit{-ā} is unaccented and the thematic vowel which is reduced in context forms, is preserved, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמָ֑עָה} \textit{hear!}.
	
	% Weak verbs: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֵ֑כָה}
	
	\subsection{The Use of the Imperative}
	The imperative is used mainly for commands and wishes.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמֹר אֶת־הָאִישׁ הַזֶּה} & \textit{Guard this man} (1\,Kgs 20:39) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְעַתָּה שְׁמַע לְקוֹל דִּבְרֵי יְהוָה} & \textit{And now, listen to the voice of the words of the Lord} (1\,Sam 15:1) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּתְחוּ אֶת־פִּי הַמְּעָרָה} & \textit{Open the mouth of the cave} (Josh 10:22) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קִבְצוּ אֶת־כָּל־יִשְׂרָאֵל הַמִּצְפָּ֫תָה} & \textit{Gather all Israel to Mizpah} (1\,Sam 7:5) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	Imperatives may be used with an independent personal pronoun (2nd person) as subject, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֵךְ אַתָּה} \textit{Come!} (Judg 9:14).
	
	The imperative may be used for addressing a superior like a king or God without being impolite.
	
	The imperative is never used with a negative. Instead, either the jussive with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַל} is used (the so-called prohibitive) is used or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} with the prefix conjugation (\textit{yiqṭol} form) (the so-called vetitive). The prohibitive is usually used for specific negative commands in a certain situation, whereas the vetitive typically occurs in general prohibitions in legal texts. Either form, however, can be found in contexts where one would expect the other.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַל־תִּשְׁפְּכוּ־דָם} & \textit{Do not shed blood} (Gen 37:22) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַל־תַּעֲמֹד} & \textit{Don't stop} (1\,Sam 20:38) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא־תִכְרֹת לָהֶם וְלֵאלֹהֵיהֶם בְּרִית} & \textit{Do not make a covenant with them or their gods} (Exod 23:32) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
The three volitive forms, the imperative, the jussive and the cohortative, may be followed by the particle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָא}. The function of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָא} is not completely clear. It may be indicating a polite request. According to a  different interpretation, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָא} is used if the speaker expects some resistance to the request or command or if the request comes unexpectedly or does not flow from the context. It is advisable to leave \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָא} untranslated.

	\section{Nouns with Enclitic Pronouns}
	
	Nouns may be combined with enclitic personal pronouns (ePP) to express the idea of possession. They are attached directly to the noun which may then undergo changes in its form (see below), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּיתִי} \textit{my house}. Most forms of the enclitic personal pronouns show formal similarities with the corresponding independent personal pronouns.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{longtable}{llllrrl}
			& & & & ePP & iPP & \\

		\end{longtable}
	\end{center}
	
	Enclitic personal may also express other ideas than possession like the object of an implied action, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲמָסִי} \textit{the wrong done to me} (Gen 16:5).
	
	\subsection{Singular Nouns with Enclitic Personal Pronoun}
	
	With singular nouns, the connecting vowels /ā/ and /ē/ are used for the forms with the 2 f.\ sg.\, 3 f.\ sg.\, 1 c.\ pl.\, 3 m./f.\ pl.\  enclitic pronouns.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes about the Form of Enclitic Personal Pronouns on Singular Nouns}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item Distinct pausal forms are only found with the 2 m.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun with singular nouns (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סוּסֶ֑ךָ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סוּסָתֶ֑ךָ})  and the 1 c.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun with plural nouns (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סוּסָ֑י}).
		\item The 3 m.\ sg.\ enclitic personal pronoun was originally \textit{-hū}. Together with the connecting vowel /a/ the suffix developed on singular nouns from \textit{--áhū} via elision (loss) of the intervocalic /h/ and contraction of the diphthong to its current form: \textit{-áhū} > \textit{-aw} > \textit{-ō}. The spelling of the 3 m.\ sg.\ enclitic personal pronoun in Hebrew inscriptions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}– reflects the older form with /h/ before it elision, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בדה}[\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע}] \textit{his servant} (Lachish 2:5). The same spelling is sometimes found in the Hebrew Bible, e.g., the Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אהלה} with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָהֳלוֺ} in Gen 12:8.
		\item With nouns ending in \textit{segol-he} (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂדֶה}) the enclitic pronoun 3 masc.\ sg.\ is \textit{-ēhū}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂדֵהוּ} \textit{his field}.
		\item With the nouns \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָב} (cs.\ st.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲבִי}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָח} (cs.\ st.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲחִי}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פֶּה} (cs.\ st.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּי}) the 3 m.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun is either \textit{-hū} or \textit{-w}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָבִ֫יהוּ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָבִיו} \textit{ʾāḇīw}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָחִ֫יהוּ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָחִיו} \textit{ʾāḥīw}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּ֫יהוּ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּיו} \textit{pīw}.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Plural Nouns with Enclitic Personal Pronoun}
	
	With plural nouns with the plural ending \textit{-īm}, the enclitic pronouns are attached to the original form of cs.\ st.\ with subsequent vowel contraction in all forms except the forms with 1 c.\ sg.\ and 2 f.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes about the Form of Enclitic Personal Pronouns on Plural Nouns}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item The 3 m.\ sg.\ enclitic personal pronoun with plural nouns is pronounced \textit{-āw} (the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} is \emph{not} pronounced), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָמָיו} \textit{yāmāw} \textit{his days}. This is often reflected in the phonetic spelling without \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} in the Ketiv, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ואנשו} \textit{and his men} (with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַאֲנָשָׁיו}) (1\,Sam 23:4). This phonetic spelling is already attested in a Hebrew inscription from the early 6th century BCE: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אנשו} \textit{his men} (Lachish 3:18).
		\item With plural nouns with the ending \textit{-ōt} the 3 m.\ pl.\ suffix may be \textit{-ām}, especially with the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָב}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲבוֹתָם} \textit{their fathers} (the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲבוֹתֵיהֶם} is only attested in Late Biblical Hebrew), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמוֹתָם} \textit{their names}. With the 3 f.\ pl.\ suffix the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁמוֹתָן} \textit{their names} is attested.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Changes of Nouns with Enclitic Personal Pronouns}
	Enclitic pronouns are attached to the cs.\ st.\ of nouns. This can be clearly seen with feminine nouns with feminine ending.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{rrrl}
			\multicolumn{1}{c}{abs.\ st.} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{cs.\ st.} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{with sfx.} & \\
			\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁפְחָה} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁפְחַת} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁפְחָתָהּ} & \textit{her maidservant} \\
			\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִשָּׁה} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵשֶׁת} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִשְׁתִּי} & \textit{my wife} \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	Vowel changes may happen when an enclitic pronoun is attached, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּבָרַי} \textit{my words}. For details see Chapter 4.
	
	Enclitic pronouns on nouns ending in \textit{segol-he} are attached to the last root consonant of the noun, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂדְךָ} \textit{your field}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׂדָהּ} \textit{her field}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַחֲנֵ֫הוּ} \textit{his army}.
	
	With geminate nouns, the gemination is restored when enclitic pronouns are attached, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַמּוֺ} \textit{his people}.
	
	For irregular nouns with enclitic pronouns see Chapter 5.
	
	
	\section{The Participle}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Participle Active Qal}
	
	The participle in Hebrew is a verbal noun (or verbal adjective) which is inflected for gender and number like the adjective. The participle active Qal has the following forms:
	
	\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.4}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
			\hline
			& Masculine & Feminine \\
			\hline
			Singular & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּתֵב} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּתֶ֫בֶת} \\
			Plural & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּתְבִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּתְבוֺת} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item In the Masoretic Text, the plene spelling of the participle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כּוֺתֵב} is much less frequent than the defective spelling \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּתֵב}.
		\item The vowel /ō/ is unchangeable. This vowel developed via the Canaanite sound change \textit{*kātib > kōtēḇ}.
		\item The f.\ sg.\ form has the alternative form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּתְבָה}.
		\item Verbs with gutturals show the expected vowel changes: Verbs II gutt. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֹּחֲרִים}, etc.; verbs III gutt. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֹׁלֵחַ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֹׁלַ֫חַת}.
		\item Stative verbs form a participle with the vowel pattern \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּבֵד} with the forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּבֵד} (masc.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּבֵדִים} (masc.\ pl.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּבֵדָה} (fem.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּבֵדוֺת} (fem.\ pl.).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Participle Passive Qal}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
			\hline
			& Masculine & Feminine \\
			\hline
			Singular & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתוּב} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתוּבָה} \\
			Plural & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתוּבִים} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתוּבוֺת} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Note}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In forms with an ending, the long vowel /ū/ is frequently spelled defectively, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתֻבִים} \textit{written, inscribed} (Deut 9:10).
	
	
	\subsection{The Use of the Participle}
	Like the adjective, the participle can be used as attribute, as predicate or substantivized. The same rules for the position of the attribute and the agreement between the governing noun and the attribute apply as for the adjective (cf.\ 7.4.3).
	
	The participle active is basically timeless and indicates progressive (on-going) or -- at times -- repeated events. Normally, the participle refers to ongoing events like the English present progressive but it is also used for future events, especially events in the near future.  In a past tense context it can also refer to past events. In narratives, the participle is frequently used in circumstantial clauses (with reference to the past).
	
	The participle of the stative verb with the pattern \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּבֵד} often functions like a normal adjective, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַמְּךָ הַכָּבֵד הַזֶּה} \textit{this your great people}. But it can also indicate a process, e.g., the participle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּדֵל} in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּגְדַּל הָאִישׁ וַיֵּלֶךְ הָלוֹךְ וְגָדֵל עַד כִּֽי־גָדַל מְאֹד} \textit{ and the man become wealthier and wealthier, until he was very wealthy} (Gen 26:13).
	
	The participle passive indicates a state that is the the result of a preceding action.
	
	
	\subsubsection{Examples of the Attributive Use}
	
	In the following examples the participle is used as an attribute to a noun.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַם בֹּטֵחַ} & \textit{an unsuspecting people} (Judg 18:10) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָעָם הַיֹּשֵׁב בָּאָרֶץ} & \textit{the people that lives in the land} (Num 13.28) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִזְבַּח יְהוָה הֶהָרוּס} & \textit{the demolished altar of the Lord} (1\,Kgs 18:30) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	\subsubsection{Examples of the Predicative Use}
	
	The predicative use of the participle is illustrated by the following examples.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִנֵּה־עָם יוֹרֵד מֵרָאשֵׁי הֶהָרִים} & \textit{Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops} (Judg 9:36) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רְאֵה נָא אָנֹכִי יוֹשֵׁב בְּבֵית אֲרָזִים} & \textit{See, I am living in a house of cedar} (2\,Sam 7:2) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּרוּךְ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי אֲדֹנִי אַבְרָהָם} & \textit{Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham} (Gen 24.27) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּרְאוּ וְהִנֵּה דַּלְתוֹת הָעֲלִיָּה נְעֻלוֹת} & \textit{And they saw that the doors of the roof-chamber were locked} (Judg 3:24) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רָאִיתִי אֶת־יְהוָה יֹשֵׁב עַל־כִּסְאוֹ} & \textit{I have seen the Lord sitting on his throne} (1\,Kgs 22:19) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Examples of the Substantivized Particple}
	
	Examples of substantivized participles can be found in the following references.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָרוּר נֹתֵן אִשָּׁה לְבִנְיָמִן} & \textit{Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin} (Judg 21:18) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּעַל עַל־גֹּזֲזֵי צֹאנוֹ} & \textit{And he went up to those who were shearing his sheep} (Gen 38:12) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	\subsubsection{The Active Participle and its Complements}
	As a verbal adjective, the participle also has properties of the verb in the sense that it allows certain complements to be connected with it in all its three uses (as attribute, as predicate or substantivized). These can be direct objects and/or indirect objects (Judg 21:18), prepositional objects (1\,Kgs 19:5) or local complements (Num 13:29).
	
	% Other example for a participle with DO and IO: Exod 16:29
	
	% The translation of 1 Kgs 19:5 does not sound perfect. It follows BDB.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָרוּר נֹתֵן אִשָּׁה לְבִנְיָמִן} & \textit{Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin} (Judg 21:18) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִנֵּה־זֶה מַלְאָךְ נֹגֵעַ בּוֹ} & \textit{And behold, here an angel touched him} (1\,Kgs 19:5) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲמָלֵק יוֹשֵׁב בְּאֶרֶץ הַנֶּגֶב} & \textit{Amalek is living in the land of the Negev} (Num 13:29) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	% Other examples of indirect objects: 1\,Kgs 5:24 Exod 5:10; Exod 16:19
	
	Complements can be connected to the participle in the construct state. This even applies to prepositional phrases (Isa 9:1). Adverbial adjuncts can also be expressed as dependent nouns of participles (1\,Kgs 18:19).
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גֹּזֲזֵי צֹאנוֹ} & \textit{those who were shearing his sheep} (Gen 38:12) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֹשְׁבֵי הָאָרֶץ} & \textit{the inhabitants of the land} (Exod 23:31) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֹצְאֵי הַתֵּבָה} & \textit{those going out from the ark} (Gen 9:10) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֹשְׁבֵי בְּאֶרֶץ צַלְמָוֶת} & \textit{those living in the land of deep darkness} (Isa 9:1) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹכְלֵי שֻׁלְחַן אִיזָ֑בֶל} & \textit{those eating at the Jezebel's table} (1\,Kgs 18:19) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	\section{Circumstantial Clauses}
	A circumstantial clause gives background information to the main story line of a narrative text which is constituted by a chain of \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms. The circumstantial clause can be a nominal clause (sometimes with the copular verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} \textit{to be}), a clause with a participle or a clause with finite verb as predicate.
	
	Circumstantial clauses can interrupt the main story line (Gen 18:1; 2 Kings 8:7; Gen 37:24) or they can occur at the beginning of a narrative (or episode or scene) (1 Kings 13:11). The typical constituent order of circumstantial clauses is subject-predicate.
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּרָא אֵלָיו יְהוָה בְּאֵלֹנֵי מַמְרֵא וְהוּא יֹשֵׁב פֶּתַח־הָאֹהֶל כְּחֹם הַיּוֹם} & \textit{And the Lord appeared to him at the terebinths of Mamre as he sat in the entrance of the tent in the heat of the day} (Gen 18:1) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּבֹא אֱלִישָׁע דַּמֶּשֶׂק וּבֶן־הֲדַד מֶלֶךְ־אֲרָם חֹלֶה} & \textit{And Elisha came to Damascus at a time when Ben-hadad, king of Syria, was sick} (2\,Kgs 8:7) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקָּחֻהוּ וַיַּשְׁלִ֫כוּ אֹתוֹ הַבֹּ֫רָה וְהַבּוֹר רֵק אֵין בּוֹ מָיִם} & \textit{And they took him and threw into the cistern; the cistern was empty, there was no water in it} (Gen 37:24) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְנָבִיא אֶחָד זָקֵן יֹשֵׁב בְּבֵית־אֵל וַיָּבוֹא בְנוֹ} & \textit{There was an old prophet living in Bethel. Now his son came \dots} (1\,Kgs 13:11) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	The circumstantial clause may even interrupt the clause on the main level of the narrative. In this case circumstantial clause is a parenthesis in Hebrew. In the following example the circumstantial clause is located before the direct speech which is the direct object of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר}.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר לִי הַמֶּלֶךְ וְהַשֵּׁגַל יוֹשֶׁבֶת אֶצְלוֹ עַד־מָתַי יִהְיֶה מַהֲלָכֲךָ} & \textit{And the kings asked me with the queen sitting next to him, \enquote{How long will your journey be?}} (Neh 2:6) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	A clause with the structure \textit{wə}-X-\textit{qatal} that refers to an anterior event can also be classified as a circumstantial clause.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר אַבְשָׁלוֹם וְכָל־אִישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל טוֹבָה עֲצַת חוּשַׁי הָאַרְכִּי מֵעֲצַת אֲחִיתֹפֶל וַיהוָה צִוָּה לְהָפֵר אֶת־עֲצַת אֲחִיתֹפֶל הַטּוֹבָה} & \textit{And Absalom and everyone of Israel said, \enquote{The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.} But the Lord had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel} (2 Sam 17:14) \\

	\section{Prepositions with Enclitic Pronouns}
	
	Prepositions take enclitic pronouns either in their form with singular nouns or in their form with plural nouns.
	
	The following prepositions take singular noun type enclitic pronouns: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִם}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת} (and with \textit{maqqef} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶת־}). The prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִם} follow the pattern of geminate nouns with enclitic pronouns.

	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item The only deviating pausal form is found with the 2 m.\ sg.\ enclitic pronouns; thus \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָ֑ךְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בָּ֑ךְ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִתָּ֑ךְ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִמָּ֑ךְ} instead of the context forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְךָ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּךָ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִתְּךָ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִמְּךָ}.
		\item With prepositions of the singular noun type different vowels than with the noun are used with the pausal form of the 2 m.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun, the 2 f.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun and the 2/3 m./f.\ pl.\ enclitic pronoun.
		\item In poetic texts, the form of the 3 m.\ pl.\ enclitic pronoun with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} is often \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָ֫מוֺ} (53 attestations; mainly in Ps, Isa, Job, Lam).
	\end{enumerate}	
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} have special forms when used with enclitic pronouns. Both prepositions take the enclitic pronouns of the singular noun type. The form of the enclitic pronoun of the 1 c. sg. is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִי}-.
	
	The preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} uses a longer form with some enclitic pronouns. With the exception of forms with 2 and 3 pl.\ enclitic pronoun, the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} uses reduplicated forms (\textit{*minmin-} > \textit{*mimmin-}) to which the enclitic pronoun is attached
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] with no change of consonants as in the case of the 1 c.\ sg.\ and 1 c.\ pl.\ enclitic pronoun forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמֶּ֫נִּי} (< \textit{*mimmin-nī}) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמֶּ֫נּוּ}
		\item[--] with assimilation of the final /n/ of the reduplicated preposition to the first consonant of the enclitic pronoun as in the 2 m.\ sg.\ form pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמֶּ֑ךָּ} (<\,\textit{*mimmin-ka}) (the 2 m.\ sg.\ context form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמְּךָ} and 2 f.\ sg.\ form with enclitic pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִּמֵּךְ} reflect a further development of this type)
		\item[--] with assimilation of the initial /h/ of the original form of the enclitic pronoun to the preceding /n/ as in the 3 m.\ sg.\ and 3 f.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמֶּ֫נּוּ} (< \textit{*mimmin-hu}) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִמֶּ֫נָּה} (< \textit{*mimmin-ha}).

	\section{The Infinitive Construct}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Infinitive Construct}
	
	Biblical Hebrew has two infinitives, the infinitive construct and the infinitive absolute. They differ in form and usage. As verbal nouns they render the action of the verb as such, e.g., \textit{reading} in \textit{I like reading}.
	
	The infinitive construct of fientive verbs has the following forms:
	
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			& Reg.\ verb & I\,gutt. & I\,ʾ & II\,gutt. & III\,gutt. \\
			\hline
			inf.\ cs. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתֹב} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲזֹב} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֱסֹר} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּחֹר} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלֹחַ} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	Stative verbs have the forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּבֹד} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּבַד} \textit{to be heavy}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קְטֹן} \textit{to be small} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲזֹק} \textit{to be strong}.
	
	The inf.\,cs.\ of the stative verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁכב} \textit{to lie down} is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁכַב} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁכֹב}. The form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁכַב} occurs thirteen times with or without enclitic pronoun whereas the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁכֹב} is attested only four times and is used only with enclitic pronouns. Otherwise, the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתַב} for the inf.\,cs.\ of stative verbs is rare.
	
	% More information in JM §49c; LvS §45s, #423
	
	When followed by \textit{maqqef}, the \textit{ḥolem} is shortened to \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתָב־} \textit{kətɔḇ}.
	
	% Examples 2 Sam 15:8; 2 Sam 20:9; 1 Kgs 5:20
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Note}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The inf.\,cs.\ with the prefixed prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ} is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּכְתֹב} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּכְתֹב}, respectively. But with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לִכְתֹּב} with \textit{dageš lene} in the second root consonant.
	
	\subsection{The Infinitive Construct with Enclitic Pronouns}
	
	With enclitic pronouns the infinitive construct has the following forms.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|ll|r|r|}
			\hline
			& & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Sing. Pron.} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Pl. Pron.} \\
			\hline
			1 & c. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבִי} / \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבֵנִי} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבֵנוּ} \\
			\hline
			\multirow{2}{*}{2} & m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבְּךָ} / \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתָבְךָ} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבְּכֶם} / \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתָבְכֶם} \\
			& f. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבֵךְ} & \\
			\hline
			\multirow{2}{*}{3} & m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבוֺ} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבָם} \\
			& f. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבָהּ} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item The \textit{qameṣ} with the first root consonant is a \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלְחִי} \textit{šɔlḥī} \textit{my sending}. Likewise, when the \textit{qameṣ} is with the second root consonant, it is a \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf} as well, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲכָלְכֵם} \textit{ʾăḵɔlḵæm} \textit{your eating}.
		\item There are two distinct forms of the 1 c.\ sg.\ enclitic pronoun. In the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבִי} the enclitic pronoun expresses the subject of the infinitive construct whereas in the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבֵנִי} the enclitic pronoun expresses the object, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְשָׁכְנִי} \textit{that I might dwell} (Exod 29:46), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְלָכְדֵנִי} \textit{to capture me} (Jer 18:22). All other suffixes can either express the subject of the infinitive construct or the object.
		\item Instead of \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf}, the vowel \textit{ḥireq} is sometimes found with the first root consonant, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁבְרִי} \textit{my breaking}. The vowel \textit{ḥireq} is also used for the inf.\,cs.\ with the thematic vowel /a/ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתַב}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁכְבָהּ} \textit{her lying} (Gen 19:33).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\subsection{The Use of the Infinitive Construct}
	
	\subsubsection{The Infinitive Construct as a Verbal Noun}
	
	The infinitive construct can be used just like regular nouns as subject (1\,Sam 15:22) or object of the clause (Deut 2:7). The infinitive construct may be used as it is or it may be preceded by the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} (1\,Sam 15:22). It is also used as the dependent noun in a construct chain (Ruth 1:1).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִנֵּה שְׁמֹעַ מִזֶּבַח טוֹב לְהַקְשִׁיב מֵחֵלֶב אֵילִים} & \textit{Obeying is better than sacrifice; listening [is better] than the fat of rams} (1\,Sam 15:22) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָדַע לֶכְתְּךָ אֶת־הַמִּדְבָּר הַגָּדֹל הַזֶּה} & \textit{He knows your walking through this great desert} (Deut 2:7) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי בִּימֵי שְׁפֹט הַשֹּׁפְטִים וַיְהִי רָעָב בָּאָרֶץ} & \textit{In the days of the ruling of the judges
			there was a famine in the land} (Ruth 1:1) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\subsubsection{The Infinitive Construct with Prepositions in Adverbial Constructions}
	
	With the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} the infinitive construct is frequently used as final or consecutive adjunct (Gen 37:25; 1\,Kgs 16:2) or as modal adjunct \textit{by doing so} (Deut 6:2).
	
	% Other reference for modal use: 1 Sam 12:19

	With the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} the infinitive construct also may have modal or causal meaning (cf.\ ESV for the causal translation of the infinitive with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} in 1\,Kgs 18:18).

	The preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} together with the infinitive construct may have (negative) consecutive (1\,Sam 8:7), causal (Deut 7:8) or temporal meaning (Lev 9:22).

	\subsubsection{The Infinitive Construct as Complement}
	With some verbs the infinitive construct is used as a complement (usually with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} and at times without). The verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יכל} \textit{to be able}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חדל} \textit{to cease} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} in the meaning \textit{to allow, permit} can be mentioned here.\footnote{\space The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יכל} is a stative verb with the the vowel /ō/ as thematic vowel in the suffix conjugation. For the other forms of the verb see Chapter 13.}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְלֹא־יָכְלוּ עוֹד לַעֲמֹד לִפְנֵי אוֹיְבֵיהֶם} & \textit{And they could not stand before their enemies} (Judg 2:14) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּחְדְּלוּ לִבְנֹת הָעִיר} & \textit{And they stopped building the city} (Gen 11:8) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְלֹא־נָתְנוּ אִישׁ לַעֲבֹר} & \textit{And they did not allow anyone to cross} (Judg 3:28) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Other verbs that take infinitives as complements are: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אבה}  Q.\ \textit{to be willing}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מאן} Pi.\ \textit{to refuse}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כלה} Pi.\ \textit{to finish}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חלל} Hi.\ \textit{to begin}. These verbs will be introduced in later chapters because they are weak verbs and/or are used in a different \textit{binyan} than Qal.
	
	With some verbs the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} can be used instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כלה} Pi.\ \textit{to finish} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חדל} Q.\ \textit{to cease, stop}.
	
	The use of the infinitive construct with so-called modifying verbs will be discussed in Chapter 23.
	
	
	\section{The Infinitive Absolute}
	
	\subsection{The Form of the Infinitive Absolute}
	
	The infinitive absolute Qal has the following form:
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lr}
			Inf.\,abs. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתוֹב}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	The inf.\,abs.\ may be spelled defectively, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָכֹל}. With a guttural as third root consonant the form is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלֹחַ}.
	
	\subsection{The Use of the Infinitive Absolute}
	
	The inf.\,abs.\ is not used with prepositions, enclitic pronouns or as the governing noun in a construct chain. This fact explains the term \emph{infinitive absolute} as opposed to the term \textit{infinitive construct}. The following three main functions of the inf.\,abs.\ can be mentioned.
	
	\subsubsection{The Intensifying Use of the Infinitive Absolute} 
	
	Together with another verb form of the same root the inf.\,abs.\ is used to intensify the verbal content or the meaning of the other verbal form or the nuance in its context or a combination of all these.\footnote{\space Jan P. Lettinga and Heinrich von Siebenthal, \textit{Grammatik des biblischen Hebräisch}, 2nd ed. revised and expanded by  Heinrich von Siebenthal (Gießen: Brunnen; Basel: Immanuel, 2016), 337.} Usually the inf.\,abs.\ is used in the same \textit{binyan} as the other verbal form; but sometimes it can be in a different \textit{binyan}. The following functions can be found frequently:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item In positive statements, the inf.\,abs.\ can be used to intensify the factuality of the statement (Gen 37:33; Gen 18:18).
		\item In negative statements the inf.\,abs.\ stresses the non-realization of the event (Gen 3:4; Dan 10:3).
		\item  In rhetorical questions the inf.\,abs.\ denies the realization of the event (2 Kgs 18:33).\footnote{\space Christo H.\ J.\ van der Merwe, Jacobus A. Naudé and Jan H.\ Kroeze, \textit{A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar}, 2nd ed.\ (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), 179.}
		\item The inf.\,abs.\ intensifies the modal meaning of a verbal form (Num 35:16; Lev 7:24).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חַיָּה רָעָה אֲכָלָתְהוּ טָרֹף טֹרַף יוֹסֵֽף} & \textit{A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.} (Gen 37:33) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְאַבְרָהָם הָיוֹ יִֽהְיֶה לְגוֹי גָּדוֹל וְעָצוּם} & \textit{Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation.} (Gen 18:18) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹֽא־מוֹת תְּמֻתֽוּן} & \textit{You will definitely not die.} (Gen 3:4) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְסוֹךְ לֹא־סָכְתִּי} & \textit{I did not even anoint myself.} (Dan 10:3) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַהַצֵּל הִצִּילוּ אֱלֹהֵי הַגּוֹיִם אִישׁ אֶת־אַרְצוֹ מִיַּד מֶלֶךְ אַשּֽׁוּר} & \textit{Did any of the gods of the nations save his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?} (2\,Kgs 18:33) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מוֹת יוּמַת הָרֹצֵֽחַ} & \textit{The murderer must be put to death.} (Num 35:16) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְחֵלֶב נְבֵלָה וְחֵלֶב טְרֵפָה יֵעָשֶׂה לְכָל־מְלָאכָה וְאָכֹל לֹא תֹאכְלֻֽהוּוּ} & \textit{The fat of an animal that is dying of itself, or of a torn animal may be used for any use, but you must certainly not eat it} (Lev 7:24) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	\subsubsection{The Infinitive Absolute as Verbal Predicate}
	
	\noindent The inf.\,abs.\ can be used as a replacement for a finite form. It can either continue a preceding finite verbal form in which case it has the same function (Judg 7:19) or it can be used without a preceding verbal form. In this case it often replaces an imperative (Exod 20:8; Jer 2:2) or a different finite verbal form (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רָגוֺם} in Num 15:35).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַֽיִּתְקְעוּ בַּשּׁוֹפָרוֹת וְנָפוֹץ הַכַּדִּים אֲשֶׁר בְּיָדָֽם} & \textit{They blew the horns and smashed the jars that were in their hands} (Judg 7:19) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זָכוֹר אֶת־יוֹם הַשַׁבָּת לְקַדְּשֽׁוֹ} & \textit{Remember the sabbath day by keeping it holy} (Exod 20:8) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָלֹךְ וְקָֽרָאתָ בְאָזְנֵי יְרוּשָׁלִַם} & \textit{Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem} (Jer 2:2) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מוֹת יוּמַת הָאִישׁ רָגוֹם אֹתוֹ בָֽאֲבָנִים כָּל־הָעֵדָה מִחוּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה} & \textit{The man must be put to death, the whole congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp} (Num 15:35) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	
	
	\subsubsection{Two Consecutive Infinitives Absolute}
	
	When the inf.\,abs.\ is used after a finite form of the same verb together with another coordinated inf.\,abs., the two infinitives express the idea that the two events happened simultaneously (or nearly simultaneously).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּרְדֵּהוּ אֶל־כַּפָּיו וַיֵּלֶךְ הָלוֹךְ וְאָכֹל} & \textit{He scraped it [the honey] out into his hands and ate as he went along} (Judg 14:9) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָל־הָעָם אֲשֶׁר־אִתּוֹ חָפוּ אִישׁ רֹאשׁוֹ וְעָלוּ עָלֹה וּבָכֹה} & \textit{\dots and David went up the ascent of the} Mount of \textit{Olives, weeping as he went} (2\,Sam 15:30) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent The inf.\,abs.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָלֹךְ} may be used together with a finite form and the infinite absolute of another verb to express the idea that an event took place continually or increasingly. (In 2 Sam 5:10 even the finite verb is a form of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הלך} leaving the inf.\,abs.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּדוֹל} to express the main meaning \textit{to become greater}.)
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּסַּע אַבְרָם הָלוֹךְ וְנָסוֹעַ הַנֶּ֫גְבָּה} & \textit{And Abram journeyed by stages to the Negeb} (Gen 12:9) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּלֶךְ דָּוִד הָלוֹךְ וְגָדוֹל} & \textit{And David became greater and greater} (2\,Sam 5:10) \\

	\subsection{The Forms of the waw-Suffix Conjugation}
	
	% Action point: check cross reference "cf. 6.2.5" in the following paragraph
	
	The waw-suffix conjugation or \textit{wəqatalṭí} form consists of the forms of the suffix conjugation with an obligatory conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} also called \textit{waw consecutive} (cf. 6.2.5). The only difference to the regular suffix conjugation (Chapter 5) is the position of the stress in the forms 2 m.\ sg.\ and 1 c.\ sg.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|ll|r|}
			\hline
			sg. & 3 m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָתַב} \\
			& 3 f. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָתְבָה} \\
			& 2 m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָתַבְתָּ֫} \\
			& 2 f. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָתַבְתְּ} \\

			& 1 c. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָתַ֫בְנוּ} \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center} 
	
	% The fact that the shift of stress in the 2 m.\ sg.\ and 1 c.\ sg.\ forms did not result in vowel reduction is an indication that this phenomenon is rather late.
	
	\subsection{The Use of the  waw-Suffix Conjugation}
	
	The \textit{wəqaṭaltí} form typically continues a preceding verbal form or a temporal adverbial expression. It is, however, possible that \textit{wəqaṭaltí} is used without a semantically similar or identical preceding verb (cf.\ \textit{wəqaṭaltí} with modal meaning as in Judg 11:8; Jer 28:13; Ezek 11:17; Ezek 25:13; following a causal clause as in 1 Kgs 20:28; with reference to the past following a \textit{wayyiqṭol} form as in 1 Sam 7:16).
	
	\textit{wəqaṭaltí} often follows \textit{yiqṭol} and has the same meaning as the preceding \textit{yiqṭol}. A possible semantic difference between the two forms may be that \textit{wəqaṭaltí} adds the idea of sequence of events \textit{then \dots \space and then \dots}, whereas \textit{yiqṭol} simply refers to future time. The \textit{wəqaṭaltí} form may then refer to future events (1\,Sam 17:32), to iterative or durative situations in the past (1\,Sam 2:19; 1\,Sam 16:23) or to general truths (Gen 2:24).

	\textit{wəqaṭaltí} can follow a participle (Exod 17:6), an inf.\ cs.\ (Ruth 3:4), or a temporal adverbial expression (Exod 17:4). The verbal form may have modal meaning as in the case of \textit{wəqaṭaltí} following a volitive form.

	\textit{wəqaṭaltí} can follow a volitive form (i.e., imperative, jussive, cohortative).  \textit{wəqaṭaltí} has the modal meaning of the preceding verbal form (2\,Kgs 9:1b-2).

	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	It is possible, however, that \textit{wəqaṭaltí} is used with volitive meaning without a preceding volitive form (Judg 11:8).

	As the \textit{wəqaṭaltí} form has to appear at the beginning of the clause without any preceding element, \textit{yiqṭol} has to be used whenever an element is placed before the verb (e.g., the negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} or a constituent of the clause).

	\section{Enclitic Pronouns on Verbal Forms}
	
	\subsection{Analytic and Synthetic Constructions}
	Biblical Hebrew has two ways of connecting a pronoun as direct object to a verb. Either the object marker with an enclitic pronoun can be used (2\,Kgs 10:35) or the enclitic pronoun can be attached to the verbal form directly (2\,Kgs 13:9).
	
	% Other good verse pair with the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קבר}: 2\,Kgs 9:28 (analytic construction) and 2\,Kgs 23:30
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקְבְּרוּ אֹתוֹ בְּשֹׁמְרוֹן} & \textit{And they buried him in Samaria} (2\,Kgs 10:35) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקְבְּרֻהוּ בְּשֹׁמְרוֹן} & \textit{And they buried him in Samaria} (2\,Kgs 13:9) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	These two clauses have the same meaning. The choice between the two constructions is purely stylistic. Overall, the synthetic construction with the enclitic pronoun directly attached to the verb is more frequent than the analytic construction with the object marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת}. An important difference between the two constructions is that the analytic construction makes fronting of the pronominal direct object possible (2\,Sam 2:7).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי־מֵת אֲדֹנֵיכֶם שָׁאוּל וְגַם־אֹתִי מָשְׁחוּ בֵית־יְהוּדָה לְמֶלֶךְ עֲלֵיהֶֽם} & \textit{\dots \space for your lord Saul is dead and the House of Judah have already anointed me king over them} (2\,Sam 2:7 NJPS) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	% Other example for fronted DO: Jer 2.13
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Enclitic Personal Pronoun on Verbs}
	The enclitic pronouns on verbs are very similar to their counterparts on the infinitive construct or the noun. If a connecting vowel is used, it is /a/ (\textit{pataḥ}) or /ā/ (\textit{qameṣ}) with the suffix conjugation and /ē/ (\textit{ṣere}) with the prefix conjugation and the imperative.
	
	% Note: PC forms with the connecting vowel /a/ are attested, too (cf. GKC §60d). Action point: Add the adverb "usually" in the preceding sentence?

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In PC forms with the thematic vowel /a/ the vowel is preserved as /ā/ (\textit{qameṣ}) before the ePP, while the /ō/ (\textit{ḥolem}) is usually reduced. In the 3 m.\ sg.\ PC form with ePP 2 m.\ sg.\ the \textit{ḥolem} is shortened to \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמָרְךָ} \textit{yišmɔrḵā}.
	
	In verbs with gutturals, the expected changes occur, i.e., \textit{ḥatef šwa} instead of simple \textit{šwa}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲבָדְךָ} \textit{he served you} (Deut 15:18), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְשָׁחֲךָ} \textit{he has anointed you} (1\,Sam 10:1).
	
	The ePP 3 m.\ sg.\ \textit{-ō} is the result of the development from \textit{--áhū} via elision (loss) of the intervocalic /h/ and contraction of the diphthong to its current form: \textit{-áhū} > \textit{-aw} > \textit{-ō}.
	
	Forms of the verb with ePP 2 f.\ pl.\ are not attested in the Hebrew Bible. The ePP would have been \textit{-kæn} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֶן}-.
	
	The enclitic pronoun 3 f.\ pl.\ is \textit{-n} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ן}- (with connecting vowel, if needed). Forms are analogous to the forms with ePP 3 m.\ pl.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent With verbal forms other than the 3 m.\ sg.\ the following differences can be observed:
	
	%Examples ‎עֲבָדוּהוּ (Jdg 10:6), ‎‎מְשַׁחְתִּיו (Ps 89:21), ‎דְרַשְׁנֻהוּ (1 Chr 15:13), ‎רְדָפוּךָ (Deut 30:7),
	%‎עֲבַדְתִּיךָ (Gen 30:29), ‎נְתַתִּיהָ (Gen 38:26), ‎שְׁלַחְתִּים (Jer. 14:14), ‎יְדַעְתּוֹ (Deut 22:2), ‎עֲזַבְתָּם (Neh 9:17), ‎נְטַשְׁתַּנִי (Gen 31:28), ‎שְׁלַחְתָּנוּ (Num 13:27), ‎נְתַתִּיהוּ (Ezek 16:19),‎ מְצָאתִים (Jer 2:34), ‎יְלִדְתִּנִי (Jer 15:10), יְלָדַתְנִי (Jer 20:14), ‎מְצָאַתְנוּ (Jdg 6:13), הֲרָגָתְהוּ (Jdg 9:54), ‎יְלָדַתּוּ (Ruth 4:15), הֶעֱלִיתֻנוּ (Num. 20:5)
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In verbal forms ending with a long vowel there is no need for a connecting vowel.
		\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
			\item Verbal form 1 c.\ sg.\ SC: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְשַׁחְתִּיו} \textit{I anointed him} (with elision of the intervocalic /h/ \textit{-tīhū > tīw}); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲבַדְתִּ֫יךָ} \textit{I served you}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְתַתִּ֫יהָ} \textit{I gave her}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלַחְתִּים} \textit{I have sent them}
			\item Verbal form 3 c.\ pl.\ SC: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲבָד֫וּהוּ} \textit{they served him}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רְדָפ֫וּךָ} \textit{they pursued you}
			\item Verbal form 1 c.\ pl.\ SC: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דְּרַשְׁנֻ֫הוּ} \textit{we sought him}
			\item Verbal form 3 m.\ pl.\ PC: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִרְגְּמֻ֫הוּ} \textit{they shall stone him}
			\item Verbal form 2 f.\ sg.\ PC: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתִּזְבָּחִים} \textit{and you sacrificed them}
		\end{enumerate}
		\item In verbal forms 2 f.\ sg.\ SC the original suffix \textit{-tī} is preserved: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְלִדְתִּ֫נִי} \textit{you bore me}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְתַתִּ֫יהוּ} \textit{you gave it}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְצָאתִים} \textit{you found them}
		\item In verbal forms 3 f.\ sg.\ SC the original suffix /t/ is preserved
		\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
			\item ePP 1 c.\ sg.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְלָדַ֫תְנִי} \textit{she gave birth to me}
			\item ePP 3 m.\ sg.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲרָגָ֫תְהוּ} \textit{she killed him}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְלָדַ֫תּוּ} \textit{she gave birth to him} (with assimilation of the /h/ to the /t/ \textit{*-athu > -attū})
			\item ePP 3 f.\ sg.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲחָזַ֫תָּה} \textit{it has taken hold of her} (with assimilation of the /h/ to the /t/ \textit{*-athā > -attā})
			\item ePP 1 c.\ pl.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְצָאַ֫תְנוּ} \textit{it found us}
			\item ePP 3 m.\ pl.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גְּנָבָ֫תַם} \textit{she stole them}
		\end{enumerate}
		\item In verbal forms 2 m.\ sg.\ SC with the suffix \textit{-tā} and an ePP 3 m.\ sg.\ contraction happens, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְדַעְתּוֹ} \textit{you know him} \textit{< -tō < *-taw < *-tahū} (with elision of the intervocalic /h/ and following contraction). Other enclitic pronouns simply follow the suffix \textit{-tā}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְטַשְׁתַּ֫נִי} \textit{you have permitted me}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲזַבְתָּם} \textit{you forsook them}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלַחְתָּ֫נוּ} \textit{you sent them}.
		\item In verbal forms 2 m.\ pl. SC the suffix is \textit{-tū} instead of \textit{-tæm}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶעֱלִיתֻ֫נוּ} \textit{you have brought us up} (2 m.\ pl.\ SC Hiphil \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עלה} with ePP 1 c.\ pl.).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	
	
	\subsection{The Enclitic Personal Pronoun with Energic Nun}
	In a number of cases an additional \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נ} is used between the verbal form and the enclitic pronoun. This \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נ} is called \textit{energic Nun} and is considered a residue of an early energic mode (cf.\ Chapter 6). It is almost always used in PC forms without suffix. Instances of the energic Nun with the jussive, the \textit{wayyiqṭol} form or the imperative are infrequent. The energic Nun does not change the meaning of the form when compared to the forms without. The following forms of the ePP with energic Nun are attested.
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{llr}
			sg. & 3 m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמְרֶ֫נּוּ} \\
			& 3 f. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמְרֶ֫נָּה} \\
			& 2 m. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמְרֶ֫ךָּ} \\
			& 1 c. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמְרֶ֫נִּי} \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The gemination of the /n/ in the forms with 3 m./f.\ sg. ePP is the result of assimilation of the /h/ of the ePP to the preceding /n/: \textit{-ænnū < *-ænhū} and \textit{-ænnā < *-ænhā}, respectively.
	
	The gemination of the /n/ in the forms with 2 m.\ sg. ePP is the result of assimilation of the /n/ to the following /k/ of the ePP: \textit{-ækkā < *-ænkā}.
	
	In forms of the PC with the thematic vowel /a/, the vowel is preserved as \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁמָעֶ֫ךָּ} \textit{he will hear you}.
	
	
	
	\section{Existential Clauses}
	To make statements about the existence or non-existence of somebody or something Hebrew uses the particles \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵשׁ}  \textit{there is} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַיִן} \textit{there is not} which is used in the cs.\ st.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵין} most of the time.

	\section{Particles with Enclitic Pronouns}
	A number of particles can be used with enclitic pronouns. In some forms, an additional \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נ} is found which is similar to the energic Nun with verbal forms.

	Alternative forms are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִנֵּ֫הוּ}  (Jer 18:3 Ketiv) instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִנּוֺ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁכֶם} (Deut 13:14) instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶשְׁכֶם}.
	
	\section{Negative Nominal Clauses}
	In order to form negative nominal clauses, Hebrew uses the negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַיִן} or, more frequently, its cs.\ st.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵין}. The negative \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא}, however, is also used for this purpose.

	\section{Weak Verbs in Biblical Hebrew}
	
	\noindent Strong verbs are verbs that have three root consonants in all \emph{all} their forms. Weak verbs, on the other hand, are verbs that do not have three root consonants in all their forms, either because one of the three root consonants is weak and prone to be lost or because they do not have more than two root consonants.
	
	The weak root consonant can be found in first position in the root or in third position. Verbal roots with two weak root consonants are called \emph{doubly weak} verbs. Verbal roots with a vocalic element in the middle as weakness -- the II\,w/y verbs in the table below -- are verbs with only two root consonants. These verbal roots are also called \emph{hollow roots}. The geminate verb with a doubled second root consonant is a case apart. 
	
	The classes of weak verbs are identified by different names in Hebrew grammars. The Hebrew designation of weak verbal roots is based on the root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פעל} \textit{to do, make}. The \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פ} represents the first, the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} the second and the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ל} the third root consonant. In this textbook the romanized designations are used.
	
	% Reason: The romanized designations agree in form with designations like II\.gutt.

	\section{Weak Verbs: I \textit{n} Verbs}
	
	I\,\textit{n} verbs have /n/ as the first root consonant. The consonant /n/ is weak because it is assimilated to the following consonant if this follows the /n/ immediately, e.g., \textit{-nC- > -CC-}. The following forms of I\,\textit{n} verbs in the Qal stem are weak.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item The forms of the prefix conjugation including its related forms, the jussive and the cohortative, because of the assimilation of the /n/ to the following second root consonant: \textit{*yinC\textsubscript{2}VC\textsubscript{3} > yiC\textsubscript{2}C\textsubscript{2}VC\textsubscript{3}}, e.g., \textit{*yinpōl > yippōl} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִפֹּל} \textit{he will fall}, \textit{*yingaš > yiggaš} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִגַּשׁ} \textit{he will approach}. In these forms the /n/ does not appear as a consonant anymore, but only in the \textit{dageš forte} in the second root consonant. The assimilation, however, of the /n/ does \emph{not} happen, when the second root consonant is a guttural, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִנְחַל} \textit{he will inherit}.
		\item The imperative and the inf.\ cs.\ of I\,\textit{n} verbs with /a/ as the thematic vowel in the prefix conjugation and the imperative and inf.\ cs.\ of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} \textit{to give} are weak forms. In these forms the /n/ is lost completely.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The very frequent verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} \textit{to give} has the exceptional vowel pattern \textit{a--i} in the prefix conjugation Qal: \textit{*yattin > yittēn} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתֵּן} \textit{he will give} (with attenuation of \textit{a > i} in closed unstressed syllable).
	
	The very frequent verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח} \textit{to take} behaves like a I\,\textit{n} verb. The prefix conjugation forms, the imperative and the inf.\ cs.\ are weak.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent I\,\textit{n} verbs have either the \textit{i--o} or the \textit{i--a} vowel pattern without a semantic difference between fientive and stative meaning.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח} looses the \textit{dageš forte} in the second root consonant in context forms of the prefix conjugation with vocalic suffix, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִקְחוּ} \textit{they will take}.
	
	The \textit{dageš lene} in the 2 f.\ sg.\ SC form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָקַחַתְּ} distinguishes this form from the inf.\ cs.\ with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָקַחַת} \textit{to take}.
	
	In pausal forms with vocalic suffix the thematic vowel is preserved and stressed, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִפֹּ֑לוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתֵּ֑נוּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִקָּ֑חוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָ֑חוּ} (impv.).
	
	Verbs that are both I\,\textit{n} and III gutt. often have strong inf.\ cs.\ forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְסֹעַ}. Some verbs have both forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְגֹעַ} and less frequently \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גַּ֫עַת}.
	
	The inf.\,cs. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּת} of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} is the result of the assimilation of the third root consonant /n/ to the ending \textit{-t}: \textit{*tint > > *titt > tēt} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּת}. A strong form of the inf.\,cs.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְתֹן} (or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְתָן־}) is attested only in Gen 38:9 and Num 20:21 whereas the weak form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּת} is attested more than 150 times. With enclitic pronoun, the inf.\ cs.\ of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} has forms like \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּתּוֺ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּתֵּ֫נוּ}, etc. with restoration of the gemination.
	
	The imperative m.\ sg.\ of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} is often the long form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּנָה} \textit{give!}.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נגשׁ} \textit{to draw near, approach} is a so-called suppletive verb. In the Qal it is only used in the PC, imperative and inf.\ cs.; in the SC and the participle it is used in the Niphal with no difference in meaning. It is included in the table because it is the most frequent verb I\,\textit{n} with /a/ as thematic vowel in the PC Qal by far.
	
	
	\section{Weak Verbs: I ʾ Verbs}
	
	A number of verbs I\,ʾ have weak forms in the prefix conjugation. The five I\,ʾ verbs that only have weak PC forms are the verbs: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אמר} \textit{to say}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אכל} \textit{to eat}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אבד} \textit{to perish} and the two doubly weak verbs  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אבה} \textit{to be willing} (almost always with negation) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אפה} \textit{to bake} (I\,ʾ and III\,\textit{y}).\footnote{\space Mnemonic saying: The baker says, \enquote{the one who does not want to eat will perish.}} Therefore the rules of III\,\textit{y} verbs apply to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אבה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אפה} as well (cf.\ Chapter 12).
	
	The weakness is due to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} becoming silent at the end of the prefix syllable. As a result, the prefix vowel was lengthened /a/ > /ā/ and then changed to /ō/ according to the Canaanite sound shift. Subsequently, the thematic vowel became /a/ through dissimilation to avoid two consecutive dark vowels /ō/ and /u/. This development started in the 1 c.\ sg.\ form to avoid two consecutive consonants /ʾ/:
	
	\begin{center}
		\textit{*ʾaʾmur > *ʾāmur > *ʾōmur > ʾōmar} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹמַר} \textit{I will say}
	\end{center}
	
	From this form the loss of the consonantal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} spread to the rest of the PC forms. PC forms are the only weak forms of I\,ʾ verbs in the Qal; all other forms are strong.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the 1 c.\ sg.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹמַר} the root consonant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is never preserved in writing. In the other forms it is almost always preserved in writing which makes the identification of these forms easy.
	
	The 3 m./f.\ sg.\ and 2 m.\ sg.\ \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms of the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אמר} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אכל} without suffix are stressed on the penultimate syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּ֫אמֶר}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֹּ֫אמֶר}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַנֹּ֫אמֶר}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּ֫אכַל}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֹּ֫אכַל}. Pausal forms 3 m./f.\ sg., 2 m.\ sg.\ and 1 c.\ sg.\ forms, however, are stressed on the last syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמַ֑ר}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאכַ֑ל}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֹמַ֑ר}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֹכַ֑ל} including the pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֹכֵ֑ל}
	
	In the impv.\ m.\ sg.\ and the inf.\ cs., the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} takes \textit{ḥatef segol}. In the impv.\ the original vowel \textit{ō < u} is preserved as \textit{segol} because there is no need for dissimilation as in the prefix conjugation.
	
	The verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אהב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אחז} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אסף} have strong forms with preservation of the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} as consonant as well as weak forms with elision of the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֶּאֱחֹז}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֹאחֵז}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּ֫אחֶז}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶאֱסֹף}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֶּאֱסֹף}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּ֫סֶף} (!), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹסְפָה} (cohortative), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֶּאֱהַב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֹהַב}.
	
	The introduction of direct speech \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֵאמֹר} is originally the inf.\ cs.\ of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אמר} with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ}.
	
	
	
\section{Questions in Biblical Hebrew (Part 1)}
	
\subsection{Yes-No Questions}
	
Yes-no questions are usually marked with the syllable \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲ} \textit{hă} which is prefixed to the first word of the question. This prefixed \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲ} \textit{hă} is called \textit{interrogative He}. In addition to this, it can be assumed that questions were pronounced with a different intonation than statements.
	
The interrogative He is vocalized in different ways:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item Before non-gutturals with a full vowel it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲ} \textit{hă-} (Gen 4:9)
		\item Before non-gutturals with \textit{šwa} it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַ} \textit{ha-} (1\,Kgs 21:20). Sometimes a \textit{dageš forte} is added (Gen 37:32).
		\item Before gutturals with any vowel except \textit{qameṣ} or \textit{ḥatef qameṣ} it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַ} \textit{ha-} (Judg 13:11)
		\item Before gutturals with \textit{qameṣ} or \textit{ḥatef qameṣ} it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶ} \textit{hæ-} (Gen 24:5)
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲשֹׁמֵר אָחִי אָנֹ֫כִי} & \textit{Am I the keeper of my brother?} (Gen 4:9) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַֽמְצָאתַנִי אֹיְבִי} & \textit{Have you found me, my enemy?} (1\,Kgs 21:20) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַכְּתֹנֶת בִּנְךָ הִיא אִם־לֹא} & \textit{Is it the robe of your son or not?} (Gen 37:20 Qere) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַאַתָּה הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר־דִּבַּרְתָּ אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה} & \textit{Are you the man who spoke to the woman?} (Judg 13:11) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶהָשֵׁב אָשִׁיב אֶת־בִּנְךָ אֶל־הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יָצָאתָ מִשָּׁם} & \textit{Shall I then bring your son back to the land that you left?} (Gen 24:5) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	Unmarked yes-no question are also attested in Biblical. It can be assumed that in spoken language they were discernible by their intonation. In a written text, the context helps to identify unmarked questions.

		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר נָתָן אֲדֹנִי הַמֶּלֶךְ אַתָּה אָמַרְתָּ אֲדֹנִיָּהוּ יִמְלֹךְ אַחֲרָי וְהוּא יֵשֵׁב עַל־כִּסְאִֽי} & \textit{And Nathan said, \enquote{My lord, the king, have you said \enquote*{Adonijah shall become king after me and he shall sit on my throne}?}} (1\,Kgs 1:24) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	% https://www.grammarbank.com/question-types.html
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Biblical Hebrew does not have a word for \textit{yes}. For a positive answer to a yes-no question either a word from the question (Gen 24:58) or another corresponding word (2\,Kgs 18:7--8) is used. For a negative answer, Hebrew uses \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא} \textit{no} (Judg 12:5).

	\subsection{Choice Questions}
	The interrogative He is also used for introducing choice questions; the second option is introduced with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם}.

	\subsection{Indirect Questions}
	The interrogative He also introduces indirect (or embedded) questions (Exod 4:18), but \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם} is used for this, as well (2\,Kgs 1:2). For indirect choice questions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲ \dots \space אִם} is used (Gen 27:21).

	\section{Weak Verbs: III \textit{y} Verbs}
	
	Originally, verbs of the category  III\,\textit{y} were verbs with the semivowels /y/ or /w/ as third root consonant. Because of contraction of the semivowel and the vowels preceding and/or following the semivowel, forms of III\,\textit{y} verbs are often characterized by a long vowel after the second root consonant. The only form, in which the original root consonant /y/ is found regularly, is the participle passive.\footnote{\space A number of times, the semivowel may occur in other forms as well, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִבְכָּיוּן} \textit{they weep} (Isa 33:7); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשְׁלָ֫יוּ} \textit{may they be at ease} (Ps 122:6) from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁלה}; compare the adjective \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלֵו} \textit{quiet, at ease} with a consonantal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו}.}
	
	% As this vowel is spelled with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} in 3 m.\ sg.\ SC and the suffix-less forms of the PC, these verbs are called \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ל״ה} in Hebrew.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak	
	
	\noindent Verbs III\,\textit{y} were originally roots with the semivowels /y/ or /w/ as third root consonant. The diphthongs and triphthongs of the early forms of these root were simplified to long vowels, e.g., \textit{-aya > -ā} in the 3 m.\ sg.\ form \textit{galaya > galā} (cf. the original form of the strong verb \textit{*kataba}).
	
	The 3 f.\ sg.\ SC form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּלְתָה} combines the original suffix \textit{-āt} and the suffix \textit{-ā} of the strong verb. The resulting form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּלְתָה} has the same syllable structure as the corresponding form of the strong verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבָה}.
	
	The 3 c.\ pl.\ SC form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּלוּ} is the result of the contraction of a diphthong \textit{-ay-} and the 3 c.\ pl.\ morpheme /ū/: \textit{galayū > gālū}.
	
	Suffix conjugation forms  of III\,\textit{y} verbs in the Qal binyan are characterized by a long vowel \textit{-ā} following the second root consonant in the 3 m.\ sg.\ form (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּלָה}) or by the long vowel \textit{-ī} before consonantal suffixes (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּלִ֫יתָ}).
	
	Prefix conjugation forms  of III\,\textit{y} verbs in the Qal binyan are characterized by the long final vowel \textit{-ǣ} in the forms without suffix. In the imperative m.\ sg.\ the final vowel is \textit{-ē}.
	
	III\,\textit{y} verbs have distinct jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms. The 3 m./f. sg., 2 m.\ sg.\ jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms do not have the long final vowel \textit{-ǣ}. The resulting consonant cluster at the end of the word is frequently resolved by insertion of a helping vowel similar to segolate nouns, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּ֫גֶל}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּ֫עַשׂ} \textit{and he did}. The prefix vowel is stressed except with the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חיה}. Important forms of some frequent verbs are the following:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ראה}: jussive \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵ֫רֶא}, \textit{wayyiqṭol} 3 m.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּרְא} (\textit{wayyar(ʾ)} with preservation of the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} in the spelling although it is not pronounced), 3 f.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֵּ֫רֶא}, 1 c.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֵ֫רֶא}. The \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms with enclitic pronoun have consonantal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּרְאֵהוּ} \textit{and he saw him} (Judg 19:3)
		\item[--] Verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בכה}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּבְךְ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֵּבְךְ}
		\item[--] Verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁתה}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּשְׁתְּ}
	\end{itemize}
	
	Short jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms without the long final vowel \textit{-ǣ} are called \textit{apocopate forms} (Latin \textit{forma apocopata} or in the pl.\ \textit{formae apocopatae} from the Latin noun \textit{apocope} which comes from the Greek noun \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἀποκοπή} \textit{a cutting off}).
	
	At times, the long final vowel \textit{-ǣ} is preserved in jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִרְאֶה} \textit{let him see}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּבְנֶה} \textit{and he built}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּעֲשֶׂה} \textit{and he made}.
	
	% Long forms of the jussive of ראה are found in Job 3:9 and 2 Kgs 6:17.
	
	Instead of distinct forms for the cohortative, III\,\textit{y} verbs use the regular prefix conjugation forms 1 c.\ sg./pl.\ as volitive forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִבְנֶה} \textit{let us build} (Gen 11:4).
	
	The forms of the participle active are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גֹּלֶה} (m.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גֹּלָה} (f.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גֹּלִים} (m.\ pl.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גֹּלוֺת} (fem.\ pl.). The forms of the participle passive are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גָּלוּי} (m.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גְּלוּיָה} (f.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גְּלוּיִים} (m.\ pl.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גְּלוּיוֺת} (fem.\ pl.).
	
	Verbs III\,\textit{y} with gutturals  have the same vowel differences when compared to verbs without gutturals as strong verbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲלִיתֶם} \textit{you went up} (2 m.\ sg.\ SC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעֲלוּ} \textit{they shall go up} (3 m.\ pl.\ jussive), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֲלֵה} \textit{go up!} (impv.\ m.\ sg.). As a stative verb, the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חרה} has prefix conjugation forms with the prefix vowel \textit{segol}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶחֱרֶה}. The jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} 3 m.\ sg.\ are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִ֫חַר} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּ֫חַר}.
	
	% Action point: translations of all forms in the previous paragraph
	
	The very frequent verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} \textit{to be} has \textit{ḥatef segol} with the first root consonant in the 2 m.\ pl.\ SC form: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֱיִיתֶם} (the 2 f.\ pl.\ form is not attested in Biblical Hebrew). With the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} the form is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וִהְיִיתֶם}. In the PC the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} has the prefix vowel /i/ in all forms except the 1 c.\ sg.\ despite the guttural \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}. The first root consonant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} always has silent \textit{šwa}. In the \textit{wayyiqṭol} form 3 m.\ sg.\ the \textit{dageš forte} in the prefix consonant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י} is lost: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי}. The inf.\ cs.\ with the proclitic prepositions is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לִהְיוֺת} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּהְיוֺת}. The inf.\ abs.\ may also be \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָיוֺ}. There is one occurrence of a participle in Exod 9:3: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוֺיָה} (f.\ sg.).
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חיה} \textit{to live} has forms corresponding to those of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִחְיֶה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּחְיֶה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וִחְיִיתֶם}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְחִי}, etc. The 3 m.\ sg.\ SC form may also be \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חַי}, as pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָ֑י} and with consecutive \textit{waw} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָחַי}.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נטה} \textit{to stretch out} is doubly weak being I\, \textit{n} and III\,\textit{y}.

III\,ʾ verbs are characterized by the loss of the /ʾ/ as a consonant at the end of syllables. The silent (or: quiescent) \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is usually retained in the spelling of the forms which makes the identification of forms of III\,ʾ verbs easy.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent While in the suffix conjugation fientive and stative verbs are distinguished, there is no such distinction in the prefix conjugation. In the prefix conjugation, III\,ʾ verbs always have the vowel pattern \textit{i--a}.
	
	In forms with vocalic suffix or with enclitic pronouns the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is preserved as a consonant, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָצְאוּ} \textit{they found}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּמְצְאוּ} \textit{you will find}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְצָאוֹ} \textit{he found him}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִמְצָאֲךָ} \textit{he will find you}. Therefore, these forms are strong forms.
	
	In the 3/2 f.\ pl.\ PC forms of III\,ʾ verbs the vocalization follows the corresponding form of III\,\textit{y} verbs. The \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is usually retained in the spelling. At times, other forms of III\,ʾ verbs follow the lead of III\,\textit{y} verbs as well.
	
	The very frequent verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נשׂא} \textit{to lift, carry} is doubly weak (I\,\textit{n} and III\,ʾ) with elision of the third root consonant /ʾ/ at the end of syllables and assimilation of the first root consonant /n/ in the prefix conjugation and complete loss of the /n/ in the imperative and the inf.\ cs.
	
	III\,ʾ verbs do not have distinct jussive or \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חטא} \textit{to sin} as a verb I\,gutt.\ and III\,ʾ has prefix conjugation forms with \textit{segol} as prefix vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֶחֱטָא}. % Quickly browsing through Ges18 did not show more I gutt and III ʾ verbs that are used in the Qal (2025-02-05)
	
	
	\section{WH-Questions}
	
	\subsection{The Interrogative Pronouns \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי} \textit{Who?} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} \textit{What?}}
	
	Biblical Hebrew has two interrogative pronouns proper, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי} \textit{who?} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} \textit{what?}. The forms of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} differ depending on the initial consonant of the following word.
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Before words beginning with a non-guttural it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה־ ּ} (with \textit{dageš forte} in the first consonant of the following word), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה־שְּׁמֶ֫ךָ} \textit{What is your name?} (Gen 32:28)
		\item[--] Before the gutturals \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} (always) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} (almost always) it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} without \textit{dageš forte}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה אֹמַר אֲלֵהֶם} \textit{What shall I say to them?} (Exod 3:13), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה רָאוּ בְּבֵיתֶךָ} \textit{What have they seen in your house?} (2\,Kgs 20:15)
		\item[--] Before the gutturals \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה־הוּא} \textit{What is it?} (Exod 16:15), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה חַטָּאתִי} \textit{What is my sin?} (Gen 31:36) (except before the article)
		\item[--] Before the definite article it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה הָאֲבָנִים הָאֵלֶּה} \textit{What are these stones?} (Josh 4:21)
		\item[--] Before gutturals with \textit{qameṣ} or \textit{qameṣ ḥatuf} it is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶה}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶה עָשִׂיתָ} \textit{What have you done?} (Gen 4:10), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶה־הָיָה הַדָּבָר בְּנִי} \textit{What is the matter, my son?} (1\,Sam 4:16). At times, this may be the case before gutturals with other vowels as well, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶה עָשִׂיתִי מֶה־עֲוֺנִי וּמֶה־חַטָּאתִי} \textit{What have I done? What is my guilt and what is my sin?} (1\,Sam 20:1). This happens rarely even before non-gutturals (2\,Kgs 1:7).
	\end{itemize} 
	
	Both \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} can be used together with prepositions. When \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} is used with the prepositions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּ}, the forms are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּמָּה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּמֶּה}, and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּמָּה}, and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּמֶּה}; forms with \textit{pataḥ} and following \textit{dageš forte} do not occur. The following examples illustrate this use.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְמִי־אַתָּה} & \textit{To whom do you belong?} (1\,Sam 30:13) (Ps 78:25) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְמִי אֲנִי אֶעֱבֹד} & \textit{Whom should I serve?} (2\,Sam 16:19) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּמָּה} & \textit{With what?}, i.e., \textit{How [are you going to entice him]?} (1\,Kgs 22:21) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּמָּה יְמֵי שְׁנֵי חַיֶּֽיךָ} & lit. \textit{How many are the days of the years of your life?} (Gen 47:8) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The interrogative pronouns \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} can be used in construct chains, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּת־מִי אַתְּ} \textit{Whose daughter are you?} (Gen 24:47) \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֶּן־מִי אַתָּה הַנָּעַר} \textit{Whose son are you, young man?} (1\,Sam 17:58)
	
	The interrogative pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} preceded by the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} has the meaning \textit{why?} (see the next paragraph).
	
	If \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי} is the object of the interrogative clause it is always used with the object marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵת}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶת־מִי אֶשְׁלַח} \textit{Whom shall I send?} (Isa 6:8).
	
	Beside \textit{what?} the interrogative pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה} has other meanings like \textit{how?}, \textit{why?}. It may also be used in exclamations, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַה־טֹּבוּ אֹהָלֶיךָ יַעֲקֹב מִשְׁכְּנֹתֶיךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל} \textit{How fair are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel!} (Num 24:5).
	
	\subsection{Interrogative adverbs}
	
	Biblical Hebrew has the following frequent interrogative adverbs:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Local: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַיֵּה} \textit{where?}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֵי} \textit{where?}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֫נָה} \textit{where to?} (interrogative adverb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָן} \textit{where to?} with directional He), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵאַיִן} \textit{from where?}
		\item[--] Temporal: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָתַי} \textit{when?}
		\item[--] Causal: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָ֫מָּה} \textit{why?} (preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} + \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָדוּעַ} \textit{why?}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent
	
	\noindent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אָ֫נָה} may be used together with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַד} in a temporal sense \textit{How long?}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַד־אָנָה יְנַאֲצֻנִי הָעָם הַזֶּה} \textit{How long will this people despise me?} (Num 14:11).
	
	The interrogative adverb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָ֫מָּה} \textit{why?} is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָמָ֫ה} before gutturals.

	In the suffix conjugation I\,\textit{y} verbs have strong forms with three root consonants. Forms of the prefix conjugation are always weak, and so are most forms of the imperative and the infinitive construct. The infinitive absolute and the participles are strong.
	
	In the prefix conjugation, two groups of I\,\textit{y} verbs need to be differentiated. There are I\,\textit{y} verbs with the vowel pattern \textit{i--a} and verbs with the vowel pattern \textit{a--i}. The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יכל} \textit{to be able} is a case apart.
	
	The group of I\,\textit{y} comprises two groups of verbs; first, verbs with /y/ as first root consonant originally. and, second, verbs with /w/ as first root consonant originally. In early Northwest Semitic initial /w/ became /y/. As a consequence, the verbs with an original first root consonant /w/  have /y/ as first root consonant in the suffix conjugation Qal.
	
	% Previous version of the final sentence: In general, verbs with /w/ as original root consonant follow the pattern of verbs with /y/ as first root consonant (changed on 2025-03-23).

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the \textit{i--a} verbs -- represented by the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירשׁ} in the first column -- the development of the prefix conjugation form was \textit{yiyraš > yīraš} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִירַשׁ} with contraction of \textit{iy > ī}.
	
	The group with the \textit{a--i} vowel pattern -- represented by the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ישׁב} in the second column -- contains the following six verbs: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ישׁב} \textit{to sit}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ידע} \textit{to know}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצא} \textit{to go out},  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירד} \textit{to go down}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ילד} \textit{to bear, beget} and the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הלך} \textit{to go}.
	
	The explanation of the actual vowel pattern \textit{ē--ē} of the \textit{a--i} verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵשֵׁב} is disputed.\footnote{\space The same vowel pattern in its original form \textit{a--i} is found in the prefix conjugation forms of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן}.} Based on an original form \textit{*yašib} with only two root consonants and an open prefix syllable the form either developed along the path \textit{*yašib > *yašēb > yēšēb} with assimilation of the prefix vowel to the thematic vowel or along the path \textit{*yašib > *yayšib > yēšēb} with addition of the semivowel /y/ to the bring the form closer to the regular verb with three root consonants and subsequent contraction of the diphthong \textit{ay > ē}.
	
	In both types of I\,\textit{y} verbs the prefix vowel is unchangeable while the thematic vowel is reduced to \textit{šwa} in context forms with vocalic suffixes, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּשְׁבוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִירְשׁוּ}. In pausal forms the thematic vowel is preserved, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵשֵׁ֑בוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִבָ֑שׁוּ} (with defective spelling of the prefix).
	
	The prefix vowel \textit{ū} of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יכל} is the result of the contraction of the diphthong \textit{iw > ū}: \textit{*yiwkal > yūkal} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוּכַל}.\footnote{\space At face value, the prefix conjugation forms of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יכל} look like Hophal forms of I\,\textit{y} or II\,\textit{wy}/II\,gem.\ verbs, but they are indeed Qal forms.}
	
	In the prefix conjugation forms of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ידע} the thematic vowel is changed to /a/ because of the the guttural \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵדַע}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּדַע}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּדַע}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּדְעִי} etc. In pausal forms the thematic vowel is lengthened to \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵדָ֑ע}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּדָ֑עִי}. The same vowel /a/ is also found in the forms of the impv.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דַּע}, etc., and the inf.\ cs.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דַּעַת}.
	
	In the frequent doubly weak verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצא} \textit{to go out} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירא} \textit{to fear} the /ʾ/ becomes silent at the end of the syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵצֵא} \textit{yēṣē(ʾ)} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִירָא} \textit{yīrā(ʾ)}. In forms with vocalic suffix the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} functions as consonant, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵצְאוּ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּירְאוּ}. In 2/3 f.\ pl.\ forms the vowels follow the pattern of III\,\textit{y} verbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּצֶ֫אנָה} (2 f.\ pl.) \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתִּירֶ֫אןָ} (3 f.\ pl.) (cf.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּגְלֶ֫ינָה}). The forms of the inf.\ cs.\ are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צֵאת} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְרֹא} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִרְאָה}, respectively.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירא} \textit{to fear} is a stative verb with suffix conjugation forms like \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָרֵא} (3 m.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָרֵאתִי} (1 c.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְרֵאתֶם} (2 pl.). The noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִרְאָה} functions as inf.\ cs.\ besides the rare \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְרֹא}.
	
	In the 2/3 f.\ pl.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּשַׁ֫בְנָה} the vowel /a/ between the second and third root consonant is due to Philippi's Law (\textit{i > a} in stressed closed syllable).
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms of \textit{a--i} type verbs without suffix (except in 1 c.\ sg.\ forms) the stress is moved to the prefix syllable and the thematic vowel is changed to /æ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּ֫שֶׁב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּ֫רֶד}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּ֫לֶךְ}, but in the 1 c.\ sg.\ the stress is on the last syllable \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֵרֵד}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֵשֵׁב}. In pausal forms stress does not move, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּרַ֑ד} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּלַ֑ךְ}. As retraction of stress in verbal forms only happens when the penultimate syllable is open and the final syllable is closed, stress does not move in forms of the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצא} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירא} due the quiescent /ʾ/ which results in an open final syllable.
	
	Suffix-less jussive forms of I\,\textit{y} verbs of the \textit{a--i} type are frequently stressed on the last syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְיֵרֵד אֵלָ֑י} \textit{and let him come to me} (1\,Sam 17:8) but forms with stress on the penultimate syllable are also attested, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תֵּ֫רֶד אֵשׁ מִן־הַשָּׁמַיִם} \textit{let fire come down from heaven} (2\,Kgs 1:12).
	
	Verbs I\,\textit{y} with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} as second root consonant have irregular prefix conjugation Qal forms with doubling of the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} as well as forms with a single /ṣ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּצֹק} \textit{and he poured} (Gen 28:18), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶצֹּק} \textit{I shall pour} (Isa 44:3) from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצק}.\footnote{\space At face value forms like \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶצֹּק} look like forms of I\,\textit{n} verbs, although they are indeed forms of I\,\textit{y} verbs.}

	%Only the numerals 1--10 in the fourth column (fem. nouns, abs. st.) need to be memorized. These numerals are used in Modern Hebrew for counting from 1--10. The other numerals are then easy to recognize.

	\subsection{The Use of the Cardinal Numbers 1--10}
	
	The cardinal number for \textit{one} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶחָד} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַחַת}, respectively, is an adjective. It has different uses in Biblical Hebrew:
	
	% The use of  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶחָד} in the plural (Gen Gen 27:44; 29:20) and the use with the article could be included
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] When it modifies a noun, it follows the noun and agrees with it in gender and number, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִישׁ־אֶחָד} \textit{one man} (in \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנַחְנוּ בְּנֵי אִישׁ־אֶחָד} \textit{We are the sons of one man} Gen 42:13), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּיוֹם אֶחָד} \textit{on one day} (1\,Sam 2:34), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶבֶן אַחַת} \textit{one stone} (Josh 4:5).
		\item[--] In cs.\ st.\ followed by a dependent noun, noun phrase or prepositional phrase with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַחַד הֶהָרִים} \textit{one of the mountains}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַחַת עָרֶיךָ} \textit{one of your towns}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַחַד מֵהֶם} \textit{one of them}
		\item[--] Like an indefinite article, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִישׁ אֶחָד} \textit{a man} (1\,Sam 1:1), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִשָּׁה אַחַת} \textit{a woman} (2\,Kgs 4:1)
		\item[--] Like an ordinal number \textit{first}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֵׁם הָאַחַת עָרְפָּה וְשֵׁם הַשֵּׁנִית רוּת} \textit{The name of the first one was Orpah and the name of the second Ruth} (Ruth 1:4)
	\end{itemize}
	
	The cardinal number for \textit{two} agrees with the noun it modifies in number and gender, i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁנַ֫יִם} is used with masculine nouns and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתַּ֫יִם} is used with feminine nouns.
	
	The cardinal numbers 3--10 are characterized by gender inversion. This means that masculine nouns are used with number words with feminine ending whereas feminine nouns are used with masculine number words.
	
	
	The numerals 2--10 may be used in three different ways when they are used as modifiers of nouns:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] In construct state before the counted noun, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁנֵי בָנִים} \textit{two sons}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתֵּי בָנוֹת} \textit{two daughters}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלֹשֶׁת בָּנָיו} \textit{his three sons}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלֹשׁ סְאִים} \textit{three seahs} (sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׂאָה}, f.)
		\item[--] In absolute state before the counted noun,  e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁנַיִם־אֲנָשִׁים} \textit{two men}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתַּיִם נָשִׁים} \textit{two women}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלֹשָׁה בָנִים} \textit{three sons}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁלֹשׁ עָרִים} \textit{three cities}
		\item[--] In absolute state following the counted noun (especially in lists), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַמֻּדִים שְׁנַיִם} \textit{two pillars}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עָרִים שְׁתָּ֑יִם} \textit{two cities}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָמִים שְׁלוֹשָׁה} \textit{three days}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עָרִים שָׁלֹשׁ} \textit{three cities}
	\end{itemize}
	
	Numerals may be used with enclitic pronouns, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁנֵיהֶם} \textit{the two of them}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁלָשְׁתָּם} \textit{the three of them}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַרְבַּעְתָּם} \textit{the four of them}.

	Ordinal numbers are adjectives. As such, they follow the noun they modify and agree with it in number and gender. Dedicated forms of cardinal numbers exist only up to \textit{10th}. For values above 10th cardinal numbers are used. With years and months, cardinal numbers are often used instead of ordinal numbers.
	
	
	\section{Adjectives with the Ending \textit{-ī}}
	Adjectives with the ending \textit{-ī} often indicate the belonging to an ethnic group, the origin from a country, area or city. This ending is therefore called \textit{gentilic ending} (from Latin \textit{gens} \textit{tribe, people}). The ending \textit{-ī} can also be used on regular adjectives like \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָכְרִי} \textit{foreign}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָקִי} \textit{free from guilt, innocent}. The different forms of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִבְרִי} \textit{Hebrew} are as follows:
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lrr}
			& masc. & fem. \\
			sg. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִבְרִי} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִבְרִיָּה} \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The plural form may have the ending \textit{-iyyīm}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עִבְרִיִּים} (only once in Exod 3:18), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נְקִיִּם}.
	
	The fem.\ sg.\ ending may also be \textit{-īt}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁפְחָה מִצְרִית} \textit{an Egyptean maidservant} (Gen 16:1), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲרָמִית} (adv., \textit{in Aramaic}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְהוּדִית} (adv., \textit{in Judean}).
	
	The ordinal numbers \textit{2nd} to \textit{10th} belong to this category of adjectives.

	\section{Weak Verbs: II \textit{w/y} Verbs}
	
	The verbs of the type II\,\textit{w/y} have roots with only two consonants. Another term for II\,\textit{w/y} verbs is \textit{hollow roots.}
	
	II\,\textit{w/y} verbs are characterized by 
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] a vocalic element between the two radicals in almost all forms
		\item[--] vocalic suffixes on SC, PC and imperative are \emph{not} stressed
		\item[--] open prefix syllables in the prefix conjugation Qal
	\end{itemize}
	
	Unlike other verbs, II\,\textit{w/y} verbs are listed in the lexicon with the infinitive construct (without vowel pointing; except BDB); e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קום}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂים}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מות}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בושׁ}.
	
	% The following table includes all possible forms of the verb קום; not attested are at least the 3/2 fem. pl. PC forms.
	% Of the other verbs only actually attested forms are included.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The very frequent verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא} is doubly weak with elision of the /ʾ/ at the end of a syllable (cf.\ the III\,ʾ verbs).
	
	In the suffix conjugation, three types of II\,\textit{w/y} verbs can be distinguished:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] verbs with \textit{ā} or \textit{a} as stem vowel (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קום} \textit{to arise, stand up}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂים} \textit{to put}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא} \textit{to come} and most other II\,\textit{w/y})
		\item[--] verbs with \textit{ē} (< *\textit{i}) as stem vowel (in Biblical Hebrew only the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מות} \textit{to die})
		\item[--] verbs with \textit{ō} as stem vowel (only a few stative verbs, e.g. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בושׁ} \textit{to be ashamed}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טוב} \textit{to be good})
	\end{itemize}
	
	In the prefix conjugation, there are three different types:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] verbs with the vowel pattern \textit{a--u} based on the primitive forms \textit{yaqṭulu} with the prefix vowel /a/ and the thematic vowel /u/: \textit{*yaqūm > yāqūm} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָקוּם} (the majority of II\,\textit{wy} verbs including the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מות})
		\item[--] verbs with the vowel pattern\textit{ a--i}: \textit{*yaśīm > yāśīm} from \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָשִׂים} (cf.\ the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ישׁב} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} with the same vowel pattern in the prefix conjugation)
		\item[--] verbs with the vowel pattern \textit{i--a} for stative verbs with the change of the thematic vowel \textit{ā > ō}: \textit{*yibāš > yēbōš} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵבוֹשׁ} \textit{he will be ashamed}
	\end{itemize}
	
	The original prefix vowels have been changed only slightly within the parameters of Biblical Hebrew (\textit{a > ā} and \textit{i > ē}, respectively).
	
	In 3/2 f.\ pl.\ forms there are forms without and with connecting vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תָּשֹׁ֫בְנָה} without connecting vowel, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּשֻׁבֶ֫ינָה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּבֹאֶ֫ינָה} with connecting vowel and reduction of the prefix vowel).
	
	II\,\textit{w/y} verbs have distinct jussive forms in forms without vocalic suffix, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָקֹם} (but also \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָקֻם} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְיָ֫קָם}),  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָשֹׁב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָשֵׂם}.
	
	\textit{wayyiqṭol} forms of II\,w/y verbs without vocalic suffix are based on the corresponding jussive forms. In context forms, the stress is retracted to the penultimate syllable and the thematic vowel is shortened, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫קָם} \textit{wayyā́qɔm},  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתָּ֫שָׁב} \textit{wattā́šɔḇ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫שֶׂם} \textit{wayyā́śæm}. In pausal forms, however, the stress is on the last syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּשֹׁ֑ב} \textit{wayyāšōḇ}. Retraction of stress does not happen in 1 c.\ sg.\ forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאָקוּם} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאָשִׂים}.
	
	The 3 m.\ sg.\ \textit{wayyiqṭol} form of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סור} is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫סַר} with \textit{pataḥ} because of the final consonant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר}.
	
	The impv. m.\ sg.\ may be expanded by the ending \textit{-ā}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק֫וּמָה} \textit{arise!} (Num 10:35)
	
	Forms of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא} are frequently spelled defectively. The 3/2 m.\ pl.\ forms with the ending \textit{-ū} of the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בושׁ} are usually spelled defectively, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵבֹ֫שׁוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּבֹ֫אוּ} to avoid the use of two vowel letters. Defective spelling of 3/2 m.\ pl.\ forms of the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קום} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁוב} is also common, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּשֻׁ֫בוּ}.
	
	The inf.\,cs. of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׂים} is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂוּם} in most cases, but the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׂים} is attested as well.
	
	\section{Numerals (II): Numbers above 10}
	
	% This section relies heavily on Lettinga/von Siebenthal, especially the tables.
	
	\subsection{Numbers 11--19}
	The numbers 11--19 consist of the words for the units in the absolute state with masculine nouns and of the words for the units in the cs.\ st.\ with fem.\ nouns, respectively, and special forms of the word for ten \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֶשֶׂר}. Gender inversion occurs for the numbers 13--19.

	\noindent \textbf{Note}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent Rarely, the cs.\ st.\ form is used for the units with masc.\ nouns, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲמֵשֶׁת עָשָׂר} \textit{fifteen}.
	
	\subsection{Numbers 20--90}
	The numeral for \textit{twenty} is the plural form of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֶשֶׂר}. The numerals for \textit{thirty}, \textit{forty} \dots \space \textit{ninety} are the plural forms of the respective words for the units.

	\subsection{Numerals for 100 and above}
	
	The numeral for \textit{one hundred} is the fem.\ noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵאָה}, the numeral for \textit{one thousand                                                                                                                                        } is the masc.\ noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶלֶף}. Both numerals are used in the dual for \textit{two hundred} and \textit{two thousand}, respectively.

	\subsection{Notes of the Use of Numerals above Ten}
	
	% Summarized from Lettinga/von Siebenthal, §40 (343-363)
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Usually the numeral precedes the counted noun, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתֵּי־עֶשְׂרֵה אֲבָנִים} \textit{twelve stones} (Josh 4:8). % Example from LvS §40k (353)
		\item[--] The counted noun is in the plural except for nouns that are used with numerals frequently, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוֺם} \textit{day}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁנָה} \textit{year}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִישׁ} \textit{man}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נֶפֶשׁ} \textit{soul, person}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֵׁבֶט} \textit{tribe}, but also with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַמָּה} \textit{cubit}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁקֶל} \textit{sheqel}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַרְבָּעִים יוֹם וְאַרְבָּעִים לָיְלָה} \textit{forty days and forty nights} (Gen 7:12).
		\item[--] Units and tens are connected with the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁתַּיִם שָׁנָה} \textit{twenty-two years} (1\,Kgs 16:29).
		\item[--] When units, tens and hundreds are used together, the higher numerals usually come first, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֲמִשָּׁה וְאַרְבָּעִים אֶלֶף וְשֵׁשׁ מֵאוֹת וַחֲמִשִּׁים} \textit{forty-five thousand, six hundred and fifty} (Num 1:25). Deviating sequences of the numerals, however, are attested as well, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שְׁתַּיִם וּשְׁמוֹנִים שָׁנָה וּשְׁבַע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה} \textit{seven hundred and eighty-two years} (Gen 5:26), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶלֶף וּשְׁבַע מֵאוֹת וַחֲמִשָּׁה וְשִׁבְעִים שֶׁקֶל} \textit{one thousand and seven hundred and seventy-five sheqel} (Exod 38:25).\footnote{\space In the genealogies in Gen 5 and Gen 10 the smaller numerals always come before the higher numerals.}
		\item[--] For ordinal numbers above \textit{tenth} cardinal numbers are used.
		\item[--] For indication of days and years, cardinal numbers may be used instead of ordinal numbers for \textit{second} to \textit{tenth}.

	Geminate verbs are originally monosyllabic verbs with a doubled second root consonant. A number of the Qal forms of II\,gem.\ verbs are strong. The majority of forms, however, is weak.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent Vocalic suffixes are not stressed, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּסֹ֫בּוּ} \textit{and they marched around [the city]} (Josh 6:14), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תַּ֫מּוּ} \textit{they were complete} (Josh 4:1); but in strong forms they are stressed, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סָבְְבוּ} \textit{they marched around} (Josh 6:15).
	
	Fientive II\,gem.\ verbs have strong forms in the suffix conjugation Qal 3 m./f.\ and 3 c.\ pl.\ with dissociated second root consonant (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סָבַב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סָבְבוּ}) while other forms are weak with a doubled second root consonant and a connecting vowel before the consonantal suffix (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{סַבּ֫וֺתָ}).
	
	Stative II\,gem.\ verbs normally have weak forms with doubled second root consonant. There are, however, some strong suffix conjugation forms of stative II\,gem.\ verbs with dissociated second root consonant.
	
	Instead of weak forms with connecting vowel between the second root consonant and the suffix there are also forms without connecting vowel, e.g., the 1 c.\ pl.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תַּ֫מְנוּ} \textit{we have been consumed} (Jer 44:18).
	
	Prefix conjugation forms of II\,gem.\ verbs are characterized by an open prefix syllable. The vowel is preserved if the following syllable is stressed, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָסֹ֫בּוּ}.
	
	As in geminate nouns, the gemination of the second root consonant is lost in forms without an ending. When an ending is added, the gemination returns.
	
	Fientive verbs have the vowel pattern \textit{a--u} of the fientive type of the strong verb \textit{*yaqṭul(u)} with preservation of the vowel quality of the prefix vowel and slight adjustment of the vowel quality of the thematic vowel: \textit{*yasubbu > *yasubb > yāsōḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָסֹב}.
	
	Stative  II\,gem.\ verbs have the vowel pattern \textit{i--a} \textit{*yikbad(u)} with change of the prefix vowel from /i/ to /ē/: \textit{*yiqallu > *yiqall > yēqal} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵקַל}.
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms without suffix, retraction of stress is attested, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַנָּ֫סָב} \textit{and we went around [Mount Seir]} (Deut 2:1); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫הָם} \textit{and he brought into confusion} (Exod 14:24); but cf.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֵּקַל} \textit{and she became insignificant} (Gen 16:4) with stress on the last syllable.
	
	Alternative forms of the prefix conjugation have a geminated first root consonant and a simple second root consonant, e.g., 3 m.\ sg.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִסֹּב} (instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָסֹב}), 3 m.\ pl.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִסְּבוּ} (instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָסֹבּוּ}), 3 f.\ pl.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּסֹּ֫בְנָה} (instead of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּסֻבֶּ֫ינָה}). As this is normal in Aramaic, these forms are called \textit{aramaizing forms}.
	
	Participle forms of fientive verbs are strong. Stative verbs may have an adjective instead of a dedicated participle forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קַל} \textit{light, swift} (pl.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קַלִּים}) from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קלל}.
	
	The vowel pattern \textit{a--i} in the prefix conjugation is preserved with a few infrequent verbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָגֵן} \textit{he will defend} from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גנן} (Isa 31:5).\footnote{\space At face value, a form like this looks like a Hiphil form. In Rabbinic Hebrew Qal forms of the verb  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גנן} were indeed reanalyzed as Hiphil forms.}
	
	% Check II gem verbs forms without connecting vowel
	
	In a few instances, the gemination of the second root consonant is lost, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָבֹ֫זָה} \textit{let us plunder} (1\,Sam 14:36), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָבְלָה} \textit{let us confuse} (Gen 11:7) from the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בזז} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בלל}, respectively.
	
	
	\section{Conditional Clauses}
	
	% The terms "subject" and "contingent" are taken from Siebenthal, Heinrich von, \textit{Ancient Greek Grammar for the Study of the New Testament} (Oxford [e.a.]: Peter Lang, 2019), 522 and Hadumod Bussmann, Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics, 1996, p. 93 (entry conditional clause)
	
	A conditional clause indicates a condition that another action, event or state is subject to or contingent on. The condition and the contingent action, event or state may be simply be two clauses next to each other. Sometimes they are juxtaposed without the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} (Neh 1:8) but normally they are joined by means of the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} (1\,Sam 16:2; Gen 44:22).

	The main clause may simply follow the \textit{if}-clause (Exod 21:7) or it may be connected to the \textit{if}-clause my means of the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ}, the so-called \textit{waw} of apodosis (or \textit{waw apodoseos}) (Exod 21:35).\footnote{\space The technical term for the \textit{if}-clause is \emph{protasis} (from Greek \foreignlanguage{greek}{πρότασις}); the  main clause is called \emph{apodosis} (from Greek \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἀπόδοσις}).} At times, it may be difficult to identify the beginning of the main clause, but logic and the accents in a pointed text make the identification certain in most cases. In the example Exod 21:35 the main clause begins with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּמָכְרוּ} \textit{and they shall sell}. (The conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} before the conditional conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} connects this law with the preceding context.)

	\section{Accents}
	
	A fully pointed biblical text does not only include vowel signs and other reading signs as the \textit{šwa} or the \textit{meteg} but also accents. The original purpose of the accents was to regulate the musical recitation of the biblical text (JM §\,15\,\textit{e}).
	
	The accents can be divided into disjunctive accents and conjunctive accents. Whereas disjunctive accents separate words and phrases from each other, conjunctive accents join them to the following element or elements in a clause.
	
	The majority of accents are on the stressed syllable of a word while a number of accents are on the last syllable of a word (\emph{postpositive} accents) or on the first syllable of a word (\emph{prepositive accents}). Therefore, postpositive and prepositive accents do not necessarily indicate the stressed syllable of the word. An exception is the disjunctive postpositive accent \textit{pašta} which is repeated on the stressed syllable if it is the penultimate syllable, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָר֙}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֶ֙לֶךְ֙}.
	
	In this chapter the four most important disjunctive accents are introduced and then used in the Hebrew reading (Section 15.6).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	% The names of the accents follow the JM §15g-h
	
	\begin{tabular}{rll}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָֽר} & \textit{silluq} & with the last word of the verse before \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{׃} \textit{sof pasuq} (\textit{end of the} \\
		& & \textit{verse} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָ֑ר} & \textit{atnaḥ} & divides the verse into two parts \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָר֒} & \textit{segolta} & postpositive \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דָּבָ֔ר} & \textit{zaqef qaṭon} & \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Accents serve two important functions for the study of the Hebrew Bible. First, most accents indicate the position of stress which is helpful for the correct pronunciation especially of unfamiliar words. Second, accents help to identify grammatical relations between words. For example, in Exod 21:35 in Section 3 the \textit{if}-clause ends with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָמֵ֑ת} with \textit{atnaḥ}, thus marking the beginning of the main clause. In 1\,Kgs 1:19 the \textit{atnaḥ} separates between the objects of the verbal predicates \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּקְרָא} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קָרָא}, respectively.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּזְבַּח שׁוֹר וּמְרִיא־וְצֹאן לָרֹב֒ וַיִּקְרָא לְכָל־בְּנֵי הַמֶּ֔לֶךְ וּלְאֶבְיָתָר הַכֹּ֔הֵן וּלְיֹאָב שַׂר הַצָּבָ֑א וְלִשְׁלֹמֹה עַבְדְּךָ לֹא קָרָֽא׃} & \textit{And he sacrificed oxen, fattened calves and small cattle in abundance and invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army; but he did not invite your servant Solomon} (1\,Kgs 1:19) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Pausal forms are used with \textit{silluq} and \textit{atnaḥ}; but they can occur with other disjunctive accents as well.

	\section{The Niphal Binyan}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Strong Verb in the Niphal}
	
	The Niphal is the fourth most frequent binyan behind the Qal, the Hiphil (Chapter 17) and the Piel (Chapter 19). It is attested about 4140 times in the Hebrew Bible. The Niphal has mainly reflexive-passive meaning. Morphologically, it is characterized by the additional element /n/ that is prefixed as the syllable \textit{ni-} in the suffix conjugation and participle forms. In the other forms, it is placed as \textit{-n} immediately before the first root consonant and subsequently assimilated to it: \textit{\nobreakdashes-nC\textsubscript{1}- > \nobreakdashes-C\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{1}-}. The suffixes and prefixes of the SC, PC and imperative indicating person, number and gender are identical to the suffixes and prefixes of the corresponding forms in the Qal.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The forms of the Niphal have the following main characteristics:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] In the suffix conjugation and the participle, the syllable \textit{ni-} is prefixed to the verbal form, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִשְׁבַּר} \textit{it has been broken} (SC); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִשְׁבָּר} \textit{broken} (part.).
		\item[--] In the prefix conjugation forms the /n/ of the Ni.\ is assimilated to the first root consonant of the verb: \textit{*yinkatib > yikkātēb} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכָּתֵב}.
		\item[--] In the imperative, the infinitive construct and some forms of the infinitive absolute a prosthetic consonant /h/ is added to the form in order to preserve the syllable structure and the assimilated /n/ as a sign of the Niphal.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	The prefix vowel of the 1 c.\ sg.\ suffix conjugation can also be /i/ instead of /æ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִשָּׁבֵעַ} \textit{I will swear}. The prefix vowel of the cohortative 1 c.\ sg.\ is always /i/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִמָּלְטָה} \textit{let me escape}.
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} and imperative forms without suffix, retraction of stress may occur, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּלָּ֫חֶם} \textit{and he fought}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִשָּׁ֫מֶר} \textit{be careful!}.
	
	In the participle f.\ sg., forms with the ending /-ā/ are attested as well, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִשְׁבָּרָה}.
	
	In pausal forms, reduced vowels are preserved as full vowels, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִלְקָ֑חָה} \textit{it was taken}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִלְחָ֑מוּ} \textit{they fought}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִפָּרֵ֑דוּ} \textit{they will separate from each other}.
	
	At times, the vowel between R\textsubscript{1} and R\textsubscript{2} in pausal forms is /a/ instead of /ē/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּגָּמַ֑ל} \textit{and he was weaned} (Gen 21:8).
	
	In the suffix conjugation, forms with paragogic Nun may occur, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכָּרֵתוּן} \textit{they will be cut off}.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח}, which behaves like a I\,\textit{n} verb in the Qal, has strong forms in all forms of the Ni., e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִלְקַח} \textit{it was taken}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֶלָּקַח} \textit{I will be taken}.
	
	Verbs I\,\textit{r} do not have gemination of the first root consonant in the prefix conjugation, the imperative and the infinitives. Instead of \textit{ḥireq} these verbs have \textit{ṣere} in the prefix syllable of the prefix conjugation, the imperative and the infinitive construct, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּרָדַם} \textit{and he fell asleep} (Jonah 1:5).
	
	The primitive form of the suffix conjugation of the strong verb *\textit{naqṭala} is not preserved in the strong verb. Instead the form changed to *\textit{niqṭala} which explains the forms of the I\,gutt.\ verbs (see below). The primitive form *\textit{naqṭala} becomes relevant in the Niphal forms of I\,\textit{y}, II\,\textit{w/y} and II\,gem.\ verbs. The same applies to the participle.
	
	% The preceding paragraph is based on Blau, Phonology and Morphology, p. 228 except for the application of the law on attenuation a > i.
	
	% Another form that may be worth mentioning: הֵרָגְעִי (Jer 47:6)
	
	
	\subsection{The Meaning of Verbs in the Niphal}
	
	Originally, the Niphal binyan had reflexive-middle meaning but assumed passive meaning over time when the original Qal passive, of which only vestiges are left in Biblical Hebrew, was being phased out. As a consequence, the Niphal often serves as a passive to the Qal (and sometimes the Hiphil).
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item Passive: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח} Qal \textit{take}, Ni.\ \textit{to be taken} (The subject is acted upon.)
		\item Reflexive meaning: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁמר} Qal \textit{keep}, Ni.\ \textit{keep oneself, be on one's guard} (The subject affects itself with the verbal action.)
		\item Middle meaning: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁאל} Qal \textit{ask}, Ni.\ \textit{ask for oneself}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נקם} Qal \textit{avenge}, Ni.\ \textit{avenge oneself} (The subject acts in its own interest.)
		\item Reciprocal: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁפט} Qal \textit{judge}, Ni.\ \textit{enter into controversy} (Two or more entities are involved in the \enquote{action} of the verb.)
		\item Tolerative: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דרשׁ} Qal \textit{seek, inquire}, Ni.\ \textit{to let oneself be inquired of}
		\item No obvious Niphal meaning: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁבע} Ni.\ \textit{to take an oath} (no Qal equivalent)
	\end{enumerate}
	
	If the meaning of a verb in the Qal (or sometimes the Hiphil) is known, these semantic categories should be considered for  the translation of the verb in the Niphal. A lexicon will help in further specifying the meaning.
	
	
	\subsection{Guttural Verbs in the Niphal}
	Niphal forms of guttural verbs show the expected differences with the regular verb:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] change of vowel quality to /a/ or a vowel closer to /a/
		\item[--] avoidance of silent \textit{šwa} in the prefix syllable \textit{ni-} of the suffix conjugation and use of \textit{ḥatef šwa} instead
		\item[--] use of \textit{ḥatef šwa} instead vocal \textit{šwa}
		\item[--] loss of the gemination of R\textsubscript{1} in the prefix conjugation, the impv. and the infinitives and change of the preceding vowel form /i/ to /ē/ (this applies to all gutturals including \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח})
	\end{itemize}
	
	% The use of the verb שבע instead of שלח should be considered because שלח is only attested once in the Niphal. On the other hand, שלח is a useful verb because it is used in paradigms for the Qal and the Piel. The verbs שחט and עזב have only three and nine occurrences, respectively. Are their more frequent gutturals that could be used?

	\noindent Retraction of stress may occur in prefix conjugation and imperative forms without suffix, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֵּאָ֫סֶף} \textit{and he was gathered} (Gen 25:8), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּנָּ֫חֶם} \textit{and he regretted} (Gen 6:6).
	
	The original vowel /ē/ between R\textsubscript{2} and R\textsubscript{3} is restored in pausal forms of the prefix conjugation without suffix, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּשָּׁבֵ֑עַ} \textit{you shall swear} (Deut 6:13).
	
	
	
	\section{Oaths in Biblical Hebrew}
	
	Oaths and curses are frequently introduced either with the conditional conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם} for a negative statement (\enquote{cer­tainly not}) (1\,Sam 3:14) or with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם לֹא} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} for a positive statement (\enquote{cer­tainly}) (Josh 14:9; 1\,Kgs 1:13). This use of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם לֹא} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} is conditioned by the self-imprecation \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּה־יַעֲשֶׂה־לִּי אֱלֹהִים וְכֹה יוֹסִף} \textit{May God do so to me and add more also} (as, e.g., in 2\,Kgs 6:31) which means that the person who takes an oath is willing to accept divine punishment in the case of non-realization of the oath.\footnote{\space The verbal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוֹסִף} is a Hiphil jussive form of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יסף} meaning \textit{to do again, continue doing something}.} The use of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם לֹא} in oaths or curses without the self-imprecation depends on its suppression or omission although it is implied. As oaths are also taken by God (cf.\ 1\,Sam 3:14 above) \enquote{the conscious­ness of the real meaning of the formula was lost at an early period, and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם לֹא} simply came to express verily, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אִם} verily not} (GKC §\,149\,b).\footnote{\space A different explanation is offered in JM §\,165.}

	An exclamatory formula with a form of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חַי} meaning \textit{life} in this context may be used at the beginning of an oath. If followed by \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יהוה} (pronounced \textit{ʾădōnāy}) or the independent personal pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲנִי} \textit{I}, the form is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חַי} (1\,Sam 19:6; Num 14:28). Followed by other nouns the form is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֵי} (1\,Sam 17:55; Gen 42:15).

	\end{longtable}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Another way of introducing an oath is the interjection \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָלִ֫ילָה} \textit{far be it!} (literally \textit{to the profane!}). Different constructions following \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חָלִ֫ילָה} are possible; the most common one is the construction with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} and an enclitic personal pronoun and a following inf.\ cs.\ with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִן} (Gen 44:17).

	\section{The Hiphil Binyan}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Strong Verb in the Hiphil}
	
	With about 9300 occurrences, the Hiphil is the second most frequent binyan behind the Qal. The Hiphil is characterized by the additional element /h/ that is prefixed as the syllable \textit{hi-} in the suffix conjugation or \textit{ha-} in the imperative, infinitive construct and infinitive absolute. In the prefix conjugation and the participle the /h/ is elided between two vowels \textit{CVha- > Ca}. The suffixes and prefixes of the SC, PC and imperative indicating person, number and gender are identical to the suffixes and prefixes of the corresponding forms in the Qal and the Niphal.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent Vocalic suffixes are not stressed in Hiphil forms. Compare \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִכְתִּ֫יבוּ} with the corresponding Qal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּתְבוּ}.
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms and jussive forms without a suffix the thematic vowel is /ē/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּשְׁלֵךְ} \textit{and he threw} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַשְׁלֵךְ} \textit{let him throw}. With enclitic pronouns, however, these forms have the thematic vowel /ī/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּשְׁלִיכֵ֫הוּ} \textit{and he threw it [the staff]}.
	
	In the imperative the /h/ of the Hiphil at the beginning of the forms is preserved. This applies to the infinitive construct and infinitive absolute as well.
	
	The \textit{ṣere} of the imperative m.\ sg.\ correspondents to the same vowel in \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms and jussive forms. With enclitic pronoun, however, this form has the thematic vowel /ī/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַשְׁלִיכֵ֫הוּ} \textit{throw it [the staff]}.
	
	The longer forms of the imperative Hiphil is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַכְתִּ֫יבָה}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַאֲזִ֫ינָה} \textit{listen!} (Job 33:1).
	
	The explanations about the prefix syllable of the prefix conjugation forms are to be applied to the prefix of the participles, too: \textit{mVhaktīb > maktīb > maḵtīḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַכְתִּיב}.
	
	The participle f.\ sg.\ is usually \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַכְתֶּבֶת}; forms with the feminine ending \textit{-ā}  are attested, too, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַבְכִּירָה} \textit{a woman giving birth for the first time} (Jer 4:31).
	
	The primitive form of the suffix conjugation may have been \textit{*hiqṭil}. The long vowel /ī/ in forms without a suffix or forms with vocalic suffix is due to analogy with II w/y verbs. The vowel /a/ in the second syllable of suffix conjugation forms with consonantal suffixes is the result of the sound change /i/ > /a/ in stressed closed syllables (so-called Philippi's Law). A different primitive form of the suffix conjugation \textit{*haqṭal} may be assumed for some categories of weak verbs.\footnote{\space Some scholars assume \textit{*haqṭal} to be the primitive form of the suffix conjugation forms of both strong and weak verbs. In this case the prefix vowel \textit{hi-} is the result of attenuation /a/ > /i/ in an unstressed closed syllable. The long vowel /ī/ in forms without a suffix or forms with vocalic suffix is due to analogy with imperfect forms where its presence can be accounted for by analogy with II \textit{w/y} verbs.}
	
	The primitive form of the prefix conjugation was \textit{*yahaqṭil} or \textit{*yuhaqṭil}. The /h/ of the Hiphil was elided between vowels; the prefix vowel /a/ of the /*-ha-/ syllable is preserved as the vowel of the prefix syllable. The long vowel /ī/ is due to analogy with II w/y verbs.
	
	% Possible additional Note:
	% Loss of the /h/ of the Inf. cs. after preposition in 2 Sam 19:19 (best example for explanation); Deut 1:33; Ex 13:21; 1 Sam 2:33; 2 Kgs 9:15; 2 Kgs 19:25
	
	
	\subsection{The Meaning of Verbs in the Hiphil}
	
	The Hiphil has the following main meanings:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Causative (someone causes somebody to do something), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מלך} Qal \textit{to rule as king}, Hi.\ \textit{to make somebody rule as king}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ראה} Qal \textit{to see}, Hi.\ \textit{to show something to somebody}
		\item[--] Denominative (the verb is derived from a noun): noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹזֶן} \textit{ear} → verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אזן} Hi.\ \textit{to listen, hear}; noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֹׁ֫רֶשׁ} \textit{root} → verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁרשׁ} Hi.\ \textit{to put down roots}
		\item[--] Declarative: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רשׁע} Qal \textit{to be guilty}; Hi.\ \textit{to declare guilty} (cf. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רָשָׁע} \textit{guilty})
		\item[--] Intransitive (frequently from adjectives or stative verbs): \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁמן} Hi.\ \textit{to make fat} (caus\-ative) or \textit{to become fat} (intransitive; from \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁמֵן} \textit{fat, robust})
		\item[--] Without obvious Hiphil meaning: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁלךְ} Hi.\ \textit{to throw}
		\item[--] Sometimes the Hiphil functions as a causative to the Niphal: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁבע} Ni.\ \textit{to take an oath}, Hi.\ \textit{to make somebody take an oath}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נצל} Ni.\ \textit{tear oneself away, deliver oneself; be delivered}, Hi.\  \textit{take away; rescue}
	\end{itemize}
	
	If the meaning of a verb in the Qal is known, these semantic categories should be considered for the translation of the verb in the Hiphil. A lexicon will help in further specifying the meaning of Hiphil forms.
	
	\subsection{Guttural Verbs in the Hiphil Binyan}
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs I gutt.}
	
	In the suffix conjugation, the prefix vowel is changed to \textit{səgol}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶעֱמִיד}, etc.\ (cf.\ the primitive form \textit{*hiqṭil}).
	
	The prefix syllable is usually closed by a \textit{ḥaṭef} vowel: suffix conjugation \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֶעֱמַ֫דְתָּ}, prefix conjugation \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תַּעֲמִ֫ידוּ}, etc.
	
	
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs II gutt.}
	
	Verbs II gutt.\ don't show any differences to the regular strong verbs without gutturals because the second root consonant R\textsubscript{2} is always at the beginning of a syllable.
	
	
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs III gutt.}
	
	In forms of the suffix conjugation without suffix and in the prefix conjugation the long vowel /ī/ is followed by a furtive \textit{pátaḥ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִשְׁבִּיעַ} \textit{he made somebody swear}. The same applies to the /ē/ of the infinitive absolute, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַשְׁבֵּעַ}.
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms without suffix and forms of the jussive and the imperative without suffix the vowel /ē/ is replaced by /a/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַבְטַח} (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְאַל־יַבְטַח אֶתְכֶם חִזְקִיָּהוּ אֶל־יְהוָה} \textit{Don't let Hezeqiah make you trust in the Lord}, 2\,Kgs 18:30), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּבְטַח} (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּבְטַח אֶתְכֶם עַל־שָֽׁקֶר} \textit{and he made you trust in a lie}, Jer 29:31). This vowel change is also attested in verbs III\,\textit{r}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֹּתַ֑ר} \textit{and she [Ruth] had left over} (3 f.\ sg.\ \textit{wayyiqṭol} of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יתר} Hi., Ruth 2:14), but preservation of the \textit{ṣere} is attested as well, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּבְעֵר} \textit{and he set to fire} (Judg 15:5).
	
	In the participle f.\ sg.\ the vowel sequence of the ending is \textit{a--a}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מַגַּ֫עַת} (from the root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נגע}; 2\,Chr 3:11).
	
	
	\section{Hypothetical Conditional Clauses with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּלֵא}}
	
	For hypothetical conditional clauses -- the contents of both the \textit{if}-clause and the main clause are unreal -- the conjunctions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּ} \textit{if} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּלֵא} or -- with a different spelling and actually more frequent -- \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּלֵי} \textit{if not} are used (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּלֵא} is dissimilated from \textit{lūlō(ʾ)}, i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּ} + \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא}).
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמַר אַחַי בְּנֵי־אִמִּי הֵם חַי־יְהוָה לוּ הַחֲיִתֶם אוֹתָם לֹא הָרַגְתִּי אֶתְכֶם} & \textit{And he said, \enquote{They are my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had spared their their lives I would not kill you.}} (Judg 8:19) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר הָאִישׁ אֶל־יוֹאָב וְלוּ אָנֹכִי שֹׁקֵל עַל־כַּפַּי אֶלֶף כֶּסֶף לֹא־אֶשְׁלַח יָדִי אֶל־בֶּן־הַמֶּלֶךְ} & \textit{And the man said to Joab, \enquote{Even if I felt the weight of a thousand shekels in my hands I would not stretch out my hand against the king's son}} (2\,Sam 18:12 Qere Aleppo Codex) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר לָהֶם לוּלֵא חֲרַשְׁתֶּם בְּעֶגְלָתִי לֹא מְצָאתֶם חִידָתִי} & \textit{And he said to them, \enquote{If you had not plowed with my heifer you would not have solved my riddle}} (Judg 14:18) \\
	\end{longtable}

	% Other possible example: Judg 13:23
	
	\noindent \textbf{Note}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּ} is sometimes spelled \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּא} or even \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לא} in the Ketiv.
	
	Related to its use in hypothetical conditional clauses is the use of the suffix conjugation or \textit{qaṭal} form in hypothetical main clauses (Gen 18:12; Gen 21:7).

	\end{tabular}
	
	
	\section{Wishes with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּ}}
	
	As a particle, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לוּ} also introduces wishes (Gen 17:18). At times, these wishes are hypothetical (Num 14:2).

	\section{The Hophal Binyan}
	
	\subsection{The Forms of the Strong Verb in the Hophal}
	
	The Hophal is the passive form to the Hiphil; e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִשְׁלַ֫כְתִּי} \textit{I threw} (Hi.) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָשְׁלַ֫כְתִּי} \textit{I was thrown} (Ho.). There are only about 380 occurrences of the Hophal in the Hebrew Bible with most forms from weak verbs. In Modern Hebrew, the Hophal is called Huphal.
	
	The Hophal is characterized by the prefix syllable \textit{*hu-}. The vowel sequence \textit{u--a} is characteristic of passive verbal forms. In Tiberian Hebrew the prefix vowel can be either /ɔ/ (< /u/) (\textit{qameṣ ḥatuf}) or the original /u/ (\textit{qibbuṣ}). In the participle /u/ is more frequent than /ɔ/ because of the preceding labial sound /m/.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the suffix conjugation the primitive form was \textit{*huqṭila}. The thematic vowel changed from \textit{*i} to \textit{a} due to analogy to the prefix conjugation \textit{yuqṭal} and/or Philippi's Law (\textit{i > a} in stressed closed syllable).
	
	In the prefix conjugation the primitive form was \textit{*yuhuqṭala} resulting in \textit{yuqṭal} or \textit{yɔqṭal} in Tiberian Hebrew after the loss of the short final vowel and the elision of the intervocalic /h/.
	
	The imperative Ho.\ is attested only twice in the Hebrew Bible: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָפְנוּ} \textit{be turned back}  (from the root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פנה}, Jer 49:8), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָשְׁכְּבָה} \textit{put yourself to bed} (Ezek 32:19).
	
	% Include a note about pausal forms (see the exercises)
	
	\subsection{Guttural Verbs in the Hophal}
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs I gutt.}
	
	The prefix vowel of I\,gutt.\ verbs is always /ɔ/ (\textit{qameṣ ḥatuf}). There are forms with \textit{ḥatef qameṣ} and forms with silent \textit{šwa} with the first root consonant, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָהְפַּךְ} \textit{it has been turned upon} (Job 30:15) \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָעֳמַד}, \textit{it shall be placed} (Lev 16:10)
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs II gutt.\ and III\,gutt.}
	
	The attested forms do not show differences to the regular strong verb.
	
	
	\section{Wishes with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי יִתֵּן}}
	
	The interrogative pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִי} \textit{who?} and the verbal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתֵּן} (3 m.\ sg.\ prefix conjugation of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן}) are used idiomatically with the meaning \textit{Would that it may be so!}\ to express wishes.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמְרוּ אֲלֵהֶם בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מִי־יִתֵּן מוּתֵנוּ בְיַד־יְהוָה בְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם} & \textit{And the Israelites said to them, \enquote{Would that we had died through the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt.}} (Exod 16:3) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּבֹּקֶר תֹּאמַר מִי־יִתֵּן עֶרֶב וּבָעֶרֶב תֹּאמַר מִי־יִתֵּן בֹּקֶר} & \textit{In the morning you will say, \enquote{If only it were evening}, and in the evening you will say, \enquote{If only it were morning}} (Deut 28:67) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	
	\section{The Forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה} as Discourse Markers}
	
	The forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי} (3 m.\ sg.\ \textit{wayyiqṭol}) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה} (3 m.\ sg.\ \textit{wəqaṭaltí}) of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} may be used as ordinary verbs in normal verbal clauses with a subject and a predicate.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי רָעָב בָּאָרֶץ} & \textit{And there was a famine in the land} (Gen 12:10) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶל־יוֹסֵף הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי מֵת וְהָיָה אֱלֹהִים עִמָּכֶם} & \textit{And Israel said to Joseph, \enquote{I am about to die, but God will be with you}} (Gen 48:21) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	In many cases, however, the forms \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה} are not used as normal verb forms but as discourse markers to indicate the time reference for the following state of affairs as past with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי} or as future with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה}. Usually these forms are followed by a temporal adverbial phrase or a temporal clause (Gen 26:32; Hos 1:5). There are quite many cases of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה} in a future time discourse before a normal main clause (Gen 4:14).
	
When used as discourse markers, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה} should not be translated.

In line with the possible meanings of \textit{waw}-SC (\textit{wəqaṭaltí}) forms, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָיָה} may be used as a discourse marker for the past time with iterative meaning (Exod 33:9; Judg 19:30).

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the second syllable of 3 m.\ sg.\ suffix conjugation forms three different vowels are attested:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] \textit{ṣere} is the most common vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּקֵּשׁ} Pi.\ \textit{he sought} (in pausal forms one only finds \textit{ṣere}).
		\item[--] \textit{pataḥ} is less common, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קִדַּשׁ} Pi.\ \textit{he sanctified}.
		\item[--] \textit{səgol} with the three verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דִּבֶּר} Pi.\ \textit{he spoke}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּבֶּס} Pi.\ \textit{he washed} (clothes) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּפֶּר} Pi.\ \textit{he appeased, made atonement}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms 3 m.\ sg./pl.\ the prefix consonant /y/ looses its gemination because of the vocal \textit{šwa}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְדַבֵּר} \textit{and he spoke}.
	
	Geminate verbs have strong Piel forms with consonants in all three slots, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קִלֵּל} (SC) \textit{he cursed} (2\,Sam 19:22), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְקַלֵּל} (inf.\ cs.) \textit{to curse} (Josh 24:9).
	
	If R\textsubscript{2} is a sibilant (i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ס}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁ}) or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י}, and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ל} and requires a vocal \textit{šwa}, the gemination of R\textsubscript{2} is frequently lost. The following examples illustrate this phenomenon:
	
\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lrl}
			suffix conj. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּקְשׁוּ} & 3 m.\ pl. \\
			prefix conj & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּבַקְשִׁי} & 2 f.\ sg. \\
			\textit{wayyiqṭol} & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְבַקְשׁוּ} & 3 m.\ pl. \\
			impv. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּקְשׁוּ} & m.\ pl. \\
			inf.\ cs. & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְבַקְשֵׁ֫נִי} & with enclitic pronoun \\
			participle & \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְבַקְשִׁים} & m.\ pl. \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

\vspace{0.25cm}

The primitive form of the suffix conjugation form was possibly \textit{*kattaba}. In the 3 m.\ sg.\ form the vowel \textit{ṣere} of the second syllable is due to analogy to the prefix conjugation form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְכַתֵּב}.\footnote{\space Alternatively the primitive vowel may have been \textit{kittibu > kittib > kittēḇ} with the vowel change \textit{*i > a} in forms with consonantal suffix due to Philippi's law (\textit{*i > a} in closed stressed syllable), e.g., \textit{kittaḇtæm} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּתַּבְתֱּם}.}
	
The primitive form of the prefix conjugation form was \textit{*yukattib > *yakattib} which developed to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְכַּתֵּב} in Tiberian Masoretic Hebrew. The same primitive vowels were present in the forms of imperative, the inf.\ cs.\ and participle.
	
	
	\subsection{The Meanings of Verbs in the Piel}
	
	Piel verbs have the following main meanings compared to the Qal:
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] \textit{Factitive:} The Piel verb expresses that a state is brought about: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גדל} Q.\ \textit{to be, become great}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גדל} Pi.\ \textit{to make great}. The factitive meaning is the most common one.
		\item[--] \textit{Intensive:} The Piel verb expresses an intensified action compared to the Qal: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁבר} Q.\ \textit{to break}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁבר} Pi.\ \textit{to shatter, break}. (Sometimes, the difference in meaning may be difficult to discern.)
		\item[--] \textit{Iterative:} A repeated action or an action that affects a number of objects is expressed: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קבר} Q.\ \textit{to bury}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קבר} Pi.\ \textit{to bury many}.
		\item[--] \textit{Declarative-estimative:} The Piel verb expresses that the object is in a certain state: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קדשׁ} Qal \textit{to be holy}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קדשׁ} Pi.\ \textit{to declare holy}. (JM §\,52\,\textit{d}: \enquote{This may be subsumed under factitive in the sense that, whilst the factitive denotes the generation of a state or quality actually and physically, the declarative-estimative does so mentally or verbally.})
		\item[--] \textit{Denominative:} The verb expresses an event that is derived from a noun: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּהֵן} \textit{priest}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כהן} Pi.\ \textit{to serve as priest}. Denominative verbs in the Piel may have privative meaning: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דֶּשֶׁן} \textit{fat}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דשׁן} Pi.\ \textit{to take away, clear the fat ashes} (besides the meaning \textit{to make fat}).
		\item[--] \textit{Without obvious Piel meaning:} With a number of verbs, the Piel seems to be used without a particular Piel meaning, e.g.,  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ארשׂ} Pi.\ \textit{to betroth}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צוה} Pi.\ \textit{to command}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent If the meaning of a verb in the Qal is known, these semantic categories should be considered for the translation of the verb in the Piel. A lexicon will help in further specifying the meaning.

	In Biblical Hebrew as it has been transmitted by the Masoretes, the guttural consonants \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}~/ʾ/, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} /h/, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} /ḥ/ and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} /ʿ/ and the consonant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} /r/ are not geminated. At earlier stages of the Hebrew language, however, they could be doubled, but this possibility was lost in stages over time. Depending on when it was lost, Hebrew did either tolerate short syllables in now open unstressed syllables after the loss of the gemination or lengthened the vowel in the now open syllable.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent The following verbs with gutturals as R\textsubscript{2} preserve the short vowels /i/ or /a/:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Almost always: verbs with  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} /ḥ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רִחַמְתִּיךְ} \textit{I have compassion on you}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְרַחֵם} \textit{he will have compassion}
		\item[--] Mostly: verbs with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה} /h/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִהַגְתָּ} \textit{you led}, \textit{} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְנַהֵג} \textit{he will lead}
		\item[--] Frequently: verbs with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} /ʿ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בִּעַרְתִּי} \textit{I have removed}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְבַעֵר} \textit{he will remove}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent The following verbs with gutturals or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} /r/ lengthen the vowels /i/ and /a/ to /ē/ and /ā/, respectively:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Always: verbs with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ר} /r/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּרַכְתִּי} \textit{I have blessed}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְּבָרֵךְ} \textit{you bless}
		\item[--] Relatively frequently: verbs with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} /ʾ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֵאֵן} \textit{he refused} (suffix conj.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בֵּאֵר} \textit{he explained} (suffix conj.), but \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּאֵר} (inf.\ abs.) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִאֲצוּ} \textit{they disregarded}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent Where the strong verb without gutturals requires a vocal \textit{šwa} with R\textsubscript{2} (forms with vocalic suffixes or participles with plural ending) verbs with a guttural as R\textsubscript{2} have \textit{ḥaṭef pataḥ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִאֲפָה} \textit{she committed adultery} as opposed to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{דִּבְּרָה} \textit{she spoke}.
	
	When the vowel between R\textsubscript{1} and R\textsubscript{2} is lengthened, stress moves to the penultimate syllable in \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְבָ֫רֶךְ} \textit{and he blessed}. This is limited to context forms; retraction of stress does not occur in pausal forms.
	
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs with Gutturals as R\textsubscript{1} or R\textsubscript{3}}
	
	Verbs with gutturals as R\textsubscript{1} do not have different vowels than the regular strong verb.
	
	When R\textsubscript{3} is a guttural (except with weak verbs III\,\textit{ʾ}), the vowel /e/ is replaced with /a/ between R\textsubscript{2} and R\textsubscript{3} in forms of the suffix conjugation, the prefix conjugation and the imperative, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שִׁלַּח} \textit{he let go}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְשַׁלַּח} \textit{and he sent out}. In pausal forms, however, \textit{ṣere} is used (with furtive \textit{pataḥ}), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְשַׁלֵּ֑חַ} \textit{he will set free}.
	
	
	
	\section{Left Dislocation of Clause Constituents}
	
	Left dislocation is the placement of a constituent outside and in front of the clause in which it is represented by a pronominal element, the so-called resumptive pronominal element. As a result, the dislocated constituent is separated from the clause. In the following example from Gen 3:12, the subject of the clause \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִשָּׁה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה עִמָּדִי} is dislocated and taken up by the resumptive pronoun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִיא} in the clause itself.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאִשָּׁה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה עִמָּדִי הִיא נָתְנָה־לִּי מִן־הָעֵץ} & \textit{The woman that you put at my side -- she gave me from the tree} (Gen 3:12 Qere) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	% Only the PP "at my side" is taken from the NJPS.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The dislocated element can have any syntactic function. In Gen 3:12 it is the subject (see above). In the case of Gen 28:13 it is the direct object, whereas in 2\,Kgs 1:6 it is a local complement.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר אַתָּה שֹׁכֵב עָלֶיהָ לְךָ אֶתְּנֶנָּה וּלְזַרְעֶךָ} & \textit{The land you lie on -- I will give it to you and to your offspring} (Gen 28:13) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לָכֵן הַמִּטָּה אֲשֶׁר־עָלִיתָ שָּׁם לֹא־תֵרֵד מִמֶּנָּה כִּי־מוֹת תָּמוּת} & \textit{Therefore, the bed you went up -- you will not go down from it for you will surely die} (2\,Kgs 1:6) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The dislocated element may be marked for its syntactic function in the clause itself even in its position before the clause. In Gen 13:15 the dislocated element is marked as direct object; in Gen 2:17 it is a prepositional phrase.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי אֶת־כָּל־הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּה רֹאֶה לְךָ אֶתְּנֶנָּה וּלְזַרְעֲךָ עַד־עוֹלָם} & \textit{For the entire land that you see -- I will give it to you and to your offspring forever} (Gen 13:15) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּמֵעֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ} & \textit{But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil -- you shall not eat from it} (Gen 2:17) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The dislocated element may even be followed by a \textit{wayyiqṭol} form.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הַיֹּשְׁבִים בְּעָרֵי יְהוּדָה וַיִּמְלֹךְ עֲלֵיהֶם רְחַבְעָם} & \textit{And the Israelites that lived in the cities of Juda -- Rehabeam became king over them} (1\,Kgs 12:17) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Left dislocation may occur in all sorts of clauses. In Ps 11:4 it is a nominal clause.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ יְהוָה בַּשָּׁמַיִם כִּסְאוֹ} & \textit{The Lord -- his throne is in heaven} (Ps 11:4) \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Left dislocation is used to mark the dislocated element as salient for the clause, usually as the topic about which the predication is made. 
	
	The traditional term for left dislocation is the Latin expression \textit{casus pendens} because the dislocated element seems to be suspended in front of the clause. The English term \textit{left dislocation} is based on the left-to-right writing direction of English or modern transliterations of languages; it does not agree with the writing direction of Hebrew.

	\subsection{The Forms of the Strong Verb in the Pual and Hitpael}
	
	The Pual and the Hitpael are the passive and the reflexive counterparts of the Piel. As the Piel, the Pual and the Hitpael are characterized by the gemination (doubling) of the second root consonant.
	
	As a passive form, the Pual is marked by the vowel sequence \textit{u--a}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נֻתּ͏ַץ} \textit{it was torn down} (Judg 6:26), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכֻבּ͏ַס} \textit{and it shall be washed} (Lev 15:17) (except in forms with vocal \textit{šwa} with the second root consonant due to suffixation).
	
	The Hitpael as a reflexive form is marked by a prefixed /t/ before the first root consonant.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes Pertaining to Pual Forms}
	
	\noindent In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms 3 m.\ sg./pl.\ the prefix consonant /y/ looses its gemination because of the \textit{dageš forte}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְבֻקּ͏ַשׁ͏} \textit{and [the matter] was investigated} (Esth 2:32).
	
	Pual imperative forms are not attested in Biblical Hebrew. The only attestation of an infinitive is \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עֻנּ͏וֹתוֹ} (inf.\ cs. with enclitic pronoun) \textit{his being afflicted} in Ps 132:1  (from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ענה} Pu.\ \textit{to be afflicted}; Pi.\ \textit{to humble, mishandle, afflict}).
	
	As in the Piel, gemination of the second root consonant may be lost in certain consonants with vocal \textit{šwa}. In Biblical Hebrew only three forms can be found: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תְבֻקְשׁ͏ִי} (PC 2  f.\ sg.\ Ezek 26:21), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְחֻלְלֵי} (part.\ m.\ pl.\ cs.\ st.\ Ezek 32:26), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְקֻצְעֹת} (part. f.\ pl.\ cs.\ st.\ Exod 26:23; 36:28).
	
	In pausal forms, the \textit{pataḥ} is lengthened to \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֻׁלָּח} \textit{he was sent} (Obad 1:1). Forms with vocal \textit{šwa} with the second root consonant in the context forms have the original vowel /a/ as a \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חֻבָּ֑שׁוּ} \textit{it was bound up} (Isa 1:6).
	
	Geminate verbs have strong Pual forms with consonants in all three slots, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְקֻלָּֽל} \textit{he shall be considered cursed} (Isa 65:20; pausal form).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Notes pertaining to Hitpael Forms}
	
	\noindent As in the Piel, gemination of R\textsubscript{2} may be lost in forms with certain consonants as R\textsubscript{2} with vocal \textit{šwa}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתְהַלְלוּ} \textit{they shall boast}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַלְלוּ־יָהּ} \textit{Praise Yah!}.\footnote{In the Piel, this occurs with sibilants (i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ס}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂ} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁ}) or the consonants \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י}, and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ל} as R\textsubscript{2}.} Preservation of the gemination, however, appears to be frequent.
	
	Seven verbs have the vowel /a/ as thematic vowel between R\textsubscript{2} and R\textsubscript{3}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִתְאַנַּף} \textit{he became angry} (so-called Hitpaal; cf. JM §\,53\,\textit{b}).
	
	Pausal forms have /a/ in intermediate pause and /ā/ in major pause instead of the /ē/ of the context forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתְיַצַּ֔ב} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתְיַצָּ֑ב}.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\subsection{Hitpael Forms with Sibilants and Dentals as R\textsubscript{1}}
	
	When R\textsubscript{1} is a sibilant, i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ס}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׂ} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁ}, the prefix /t/ and the sibilant change position (\textit{metathesis}), e.g., \textit{*mitsattēr > mistattēr} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִסְתַּתֵּר} \textit{[he is] hiding himself} (1\,Sam 23:19), \textit{wāʾætšammərā > wāʾæštammərā} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וָאֶשְׁתַּמְּרָה} \textit{and I kept myself} (2\,Sam 22:24).
	
	In the case of the emphatic sibilant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} as R\textsubscript{1}, the /t/ of the prefix and R\textsubscript{1} do not only change position but the /t/ is assimilated to the emphatic sibilant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} becoming emphatic itself (/t/ > /ṭ/), e.g., \textit{*hitṣayyadnū  > *hiṣṭayyadnū} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִצְטַיַּדְנוּ} \textit{we took [something] as provision with us} (Josh 9:12), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִצְטַדָּ֑ק} \textit{how shall we justify ourselves?} (Gen 44:16; pausal form).
	
	In the case of the root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{זכה} total assimilation of the prefix /t/ is attested: \textit{*hitzakkû > *hiztakkû > *hizdakkû > hizzakkû} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִזַּּכּוּ} \textit{make yourselves clean} (Isa 1:16; the only example of this in the Hebrew Bible).
	
	With dentals, the prefix /t/ of the Hitpael is usually assimilated to the dental R\textsubscript{1} of the root, e.g., \textit{*mitdabbēr > middabbēr} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִדַּבֵּר} \textit{someone speaking} (Num 7:89), \textit{*hitṭaharnū > hiṭṭaharnū} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִטַּהַרְנוּ} \textit{we have cleansed ourselves} (Josh 22:17).
	
	With /t/ as R\textsubscript{1}, only one \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ת} is written, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּתַּמָּ֑ם} \textit{tittammām} \textit{you deal with integrity with [the blameless]} (2\,Sam 22:26 par.\ Ps 18:26).
	
	Assimilation of the /t/ to a following /n/ or even /k/ is attested, as well.
	
	
	\subsection{Verbs with Gutturals or /r/ in the Pual and Hitpael Binyanim}
	
	\subsubsection{Verbs with Gutturals or /r/ as R\textsubscript{2}}
	
	In the same way as in the Piel, the short vowel before R\textsubscript{2} may either be preserved despite being in an open unstressed syllable or it is lengthened /a/ > /ā/. The same tendencies for the preservation of the short vowel or the lengthening of the vowel can be observed in the Pual and the Hitpael (cf. Chapter 19). The following examples illustrate this:
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\noindent With preservation of /a/ as a short vowel:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] suffix conj.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רֻחַ֫צְתְּ}
		\item[--] prefix conj.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְרֻחַם}
		\item[--] inf.\ cs.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְהִתְנַחֵם}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִתְנַחֵל}
		\item[--] imperative: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִטַּהֲרוּ} (m.\ pl., verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טהר})
		\item[--] participle: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִתְנַחֵם} (m.\ sg.)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Note}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In pausal forms, the vowel /a/ between R\textsubscript{1} and R\textsubscript{2} may change to /æ/ because of the \textit{qameṣ} with the guttural as R\textsubscript{2}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתְנֶחָ֑ם}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִטֶּהָ֑רוּ} (compare the similar vowel change with the definite article and the interrogative He).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\noindent With lengthening of the short vowel to /ā/:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] suffix conj.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֹעֲכוּ} (3 c.\ pl.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִתְבָּרֲכוּ} (3 m.\ pl.\ with waw cons.)
		\item[--] prefix conj.: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְגֹעֲשׁוּ} (3 m.\ pl.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתְפָּאֵר} (3 m.\ sg.)
		\item[--] \textit{wayyiqṭol}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְגֹאֲלוּ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּתְגָּעֲשׁוּ} (3 m.\ pl.)
		\item[--] participle: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְגֹאָל}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִתְבָּרֵךְ} (m.\ sg.)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent Where the strong verb without gutturals requires a vocal \textit{šwa} with R\textsubscript{2}, verbs with a guttural as R\textsubscript{2} have \textit{ḥaṭef pataḥ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּתְגָּעֲשׁוּ}.
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\noindent Verbs with a guttural as R\textsubscript{1} do not have forms that deviate from the strong verb without gutturals.
	
	In verbs with the gutturals \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} as R\textsubscript{3} the vowel /ē/ between R\textsubscript{2} and R\textsubscript{3} is usually replaced by /a/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִתְנַגַּח} \textit{he will engage in thrusting with someone}. In the inf.\ cs.\ and the participle the /ē/ may be preserved and a furtive \textit{pataḥ} is inserted, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִשְׁתַּגֵּעַ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מִשְׁתַּגֵּעַ} \textit{someone behaving like a mad man}.

	\subsection{General Overview of the Forms of Verbs I \textit{n}}
	
	When the first root consonant /n/ is immediately followed by the second root consonant, the /n/ is assimilated to the following consonant. The result are weak forms. In the Qal, this could be observed in the forms of the prefix conjugation. The assimilation of the first root consonant /n/ happens in the Niphal in the suffix conjugation and the participle. In the Hiphil and Hophal it happens in \emph{all} forms. The Piel, Pual and Hitpael forms of I\,\textit{n} verbs are always strong as the first root consonant /n/ is never immediately followed by a consonant.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The endings marking person, gender and number are the same as the endings of the corresponding forms of the strong verb including the reduction of vowels.
	
	In the suffix conjugation and participle forms of the Niphal, the first root consonant /n/ is assimilated to the second root consonant: \textit{ningap̄ > niggap̄} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִגַּף}.
	
	In the prefix conjugation, the /n/ infix of the Niphal merges with the first root consonant: \textit{yin-nāgēp̄} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִנָּגֵף}.
	
	As with the strong verb, a prosthetic /h/ is added to the form to preserve the structure of the imperative and infinitives in the Niphal.
	
	For the Niphal infinitive absolute only forms that are attested in the Hebrew Bible are mentioned.
	
	In all forms of the Hiphil, the first root consonant /n/ closes the prefix syllable and is assimilated to the second root consonant: \textit{*hingida > *higgid > higgīd} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִגִּיד}.
	
	In the Hophal, the first root consonant /n/ is assimilated to the second root consonant, e.g., \textit{*hungad > huggad} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֻגַּד}. The prefix vowel is always /u/.
	
	\subsection{Verbs I \textit{n} and II Guttural: Derived Binyanim}
	
	In the Niphal, the /n/ of the root is assimilated to the second root consonant. The result are weak forms, e.g., \textit{ninḥam > niḥḥam > niḥam} (with loss of the gemination and preservation of the vowel /i/).
	
	In the Hiphil, however, the /n/ is not assimilated to the second root consonant resulting in strong forms.
	
	The forms of the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נחם} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נחל} in the following table illustrate this.

	\subsection{Verb I ʾ: Exceptional Forms in the Derived Binyanim}
	
	The forms of I\,ʾ verbs in the Piel, Pual and Hitpael are always strong. In the Niphal, Hiphil and Hophal binyanim they are usually strong displaying only the regular vowel changes of guttural verbs, e.g. PC Ni.\ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵאָכֵל} \textit{it will be eaten} with loss of the gemination (cf. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכָּתֵב}). In rare cases, exceptions to this occur with forms with quiescent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א}. The following examples illustrate this:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Niphal: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נֹאחֲזוּ} \textit{they have settled} (Josh 22:9)  and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְנֹאחֲזוּ} \textit{and they will settle} (Num 32:30); cp. the strong form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נֶאֱחַז} \textit{it was caught} (Gen 22:13)
		\item[--] Hiphil: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֹב֫ידָה} \textit{let me destroy} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אבד}; Jer 46:8); cp. the strong form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהַאֲבַדְתָּ} \textit{and you shall destroy} (Deut 7:24)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Causal Constructions}
	
	Causal constructions indicate the cause of or the reason for a state of affairs. They can be expressed as subordinate clauses or as prepositional phrases.
	
	Frequently used causal conjunctions in Biblical Hebrew are: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} \textit{because, for}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעַן}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעַן אֲשֶׁר} \textit{because}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַל אֲשֶׁר} \textit{because}. The causal subordinate clause may precede the main clause (Gen 3:14; 1\,Kgs 20:28) or it may follow it (Gen 5:24; Exod 32:35).

	\section{Impersonal Constructions (Vague Subject)}
	
	% JM §155b-i; JM §128b
	
	The vague subject (as \textit{one} in the English clause \textit{One never knows}) is used when the identification of the agent of the action is impossible or irrelevant. In Biblical Hebrew, the vague subject is expressed often by 3 c./m.\ pl.\ verbal forms (2 Sam 19:9), 3 m.\ sg.\ verbal forms (Num 35:30) or passive verbal forms (Gen 27:42). In English, passive verbal forms are often employed to translate these impersonal constructions.

	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וּלְכָל־הָעָם הִגִּידוּ לֵאמֹר הִנֵּה הַמֶּלֶךְ יוֹשֵׁב בַּשַּׁעַר} &  \textit{And all the people were told, \enquote{Behold, the king is sitting in the gate}} (2 Sam 19:9) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־מַכֵּה־נֶפֶשׁ לְפִי עֵדִים יִרְצַח אֶת־הָרֹצֵחַ} & \textit{Everyone who kills a person -- one shall kill the murderer on the evidence of witnesses} (Num 35:30) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֻּגַּד לְמֶלֶךְ מִצְרַיִם כִּי בָרַח הָעָם} &  \textit{And it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled} (Exod 14:5)\\

	\section{Verbs III \textit{y} and Verbs III ʾ: Derived Binyanim}
	
	\subsection{Preliminary Remarks}
	
	Weak verbs of the type  III\,\textit{y} and III\,ʾ have a weak third root consonant, either in the form of a vocalic element in the case of III\,\textit{y} verbs or in the form of a quiescent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} if it is at the end of the syllable. The main features of all the derived binyanim, however, are located at the beginning of the verbal form in the Niphal, Hiphil, Hophal and Hitpael or in the form of gemination in the second root consonant in the Piel, Pual and Hitpael with the exception of the long vowel /ī/ in a number of Hiphil forms. As a consequence the main features of the derived binyanim do not interact with the weak element of III\,\textit{y} and III\,ʾ verbs.
	
	
	\subsection{General Overview of the Forms of Verbs III \textit{y}}
	
	Verbs of the III\,\textit{y} type are characterized by the long final vowels /ā/ (\textit{qameṣ}), /ǣ/ (\textit{səgol}) /ē/ (\textit{ṣere}) in many forms. These vowels remain the same in all binyanim. Before consonantal suffixes in the suffix conjugation the forms vary between the vowels /ī/ (\textit{ḥireq}) and /ē/ (\textit{ṣere}). These vowels are usually spelled with the vowel letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{י}. Vocalic suffixes always follow the second root consonant directly.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent Variation between the vowels /ī/ (\textit{ḥireq}) and /ē/ (\textit{ṣere}) after the second root consonant in suffix conjugation forms is attested even within one and the same verse, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִכֵּיתִי} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהִכִּיתָ} in 1\,Sam 23:2 (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּשְׁאַל דָּוִד בַּיהוָה לֵאמֹר הַאֵלֵךְ וְהִכֵּיתִי בַּפְּלִשְׁתִּים הָאֵלֶּה וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל־דָּוִד לֵךְ וְהִכִּיתָ בַפְּלִשְׁתִּים וְהוֹשַׁעְתָּ אֶת־קְעִילָה} \textit{David asked the Lord, \enquote{Shall I go and attack these Philistines?} And the Lord said to David, \enquote{Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah}}.
	
	Verbs that are both I gutt.\ and III\,\textit{y} (e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עשׂה}) have the same vowel changes before the first root consonant as the strong verb, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נַעֲשָׂה} Ni.\ \textit{it was done} (with \textit{pataḥ} in the prefix), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נֶעֶשׂתָה} Ni.\ \textit{it was done} (with \textit{segol} in the prefix), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵעָשֶׂה} Ni.\ \textit{it is done} etc. The same applies to the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ראה} in the Niphal, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵרָאֶה} \textit{he shall appear} (Exod 23:17).
	
	As in the Qal, III\,\textit{y} verbs may loose the long final vowel in jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms without an ending, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְגַל} \textit{and he uncovered} (Pi.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתְּגַל} \textit{and she uncovered} (Pi.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּתְכַּס} \textit{and he covered himself} (Hitpa.).
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עלה} is used both in the Qal and in the Hiphil (558 and 250 times in the Hebrew Bible, respectively). Because of the guttural as first root consonant, prefix conjugation forms of the Qal and the Hiphil are identical, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַעֲלֶה} Q.\ \textit{he will go up} or Hi.\ \textit{he will bring up}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּ֫עַל} Q.\ \textit{he went up} or Hi.\ \textit{he brought up}. As the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עלה} is intransitive in the Qal and transitive in the Hiphil, the presence or absence of a direct object makes it possible to distinguish between these forms. (Ellipsis of direct objects is frequent in Biblical Hebrew.)
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{היה} has suffix conjugation and participle forms in the Ni.\ with the prefix vowel /i/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִהְיְתָה} (SC 3 f.\ sg.) \textit{it happened}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִהְיָה} (part.\ f.\ sg.)
	
	The verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נטה} Hi.\ \textit{to turn, incline} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נכה} Hi.\ \textit{to smite, strike} are doubly weak: I\,\textit{n} and III\,\textit{y}. The rules regarding sound changes of both weak verb categories I\,\textit{n} and III\,\textit{y} are applied. As a result, Hiphil forms of these two verbs show only R\textsubscript{2} while R\textsubscript{1} /n/ is only present in the gemination of R\textsubscript{2} in non-apocopate forms. The following characteristic Hiphil forms are attested:

	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נכה} is also attested in the Pual, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֻכָּה} (SC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מֻכֶּה} (part.).
	
	As in the strong verb, assimilation of R\textsubscript{1} to R\textsubscript{2} does not happen in the case of a guttural as R\textsubscript{2}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַנְחֵנִי} \textit{he leads me} (Ps 23:3; verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נחה} Hi.\ with ePP).
	
	% Only roots with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח} and  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ע} as R\textsubscript{2} are attested in Biblical Hebrew.
	
	The infinitive absolute \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַרְבֵּה} of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רבה} Hi.\ is used as an adverb with the meaning \textit{greatly, exceedingly}. The form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַרְבָּה} is used as a substitute for the infinitive absolute, but the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הַרְבֵּה} is used as infinitive absolute as well.
	
	
	\subsection{General Overview of the Forms of Verbs III ʾ}
	As in the Qal, the weak consonant \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} becomes silent at the end of a syllable and, therefore, is not a consonant anymore. However, it is preserved in writing in most cases. When vocalic suffixes or enclitic pronouns are added, the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{א} is retained as a consonant.\footnote{\space In the tables below, the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מלא} is used for the Piel, Pual and Hitpael forms because it is actually used in these binyanim. In forms where the \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ל} has vocal \textit{šwa} it looses the \textit{dageš forte}.}
	
	% For the ṣere in the 1 c. sg. Hitpa. form cf. Jer 17:16 and GKC p. 529
	% For the most forms, the tables follow Lettinga/von Siebenthal, pp. 450-453 except for the choice of the verb מלא for the Piel, Pual, Hitpael because this verb is actually attested in all three binyanim.
	% For the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִמְצֵאת} (part. fem. sg.) cf. Deut 30:11; 1 Chr 14:2.
	% For the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִמְצְאִים} (part. masc. pl.) cf. Josh 10:17; 1 Sam 19:10; 1 Kgs 22:12; 2 Chr 5:11.
	% For the form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִמְצָאוֺת} (part. fem. pl.) cf. Gen 19:15; Josh 3.5.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the suffix conjugation of the derived binyanim, the vowel between the second root consonant and a consonantal suffix is always \textit{ṣere}, whereas the Qal has \textit{qameṣ}.
	
	The 3/2 f.\ pl.\ forms of the prefix conjugation with the vowel /ǣ/ are due to analogy to III\,\textit{y} verbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּמָּצֶאינָה} \textit{they will be found}. Sometimes, forms of III\,ʾ verbs follow the pattern of III\,\textit{y} completely, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִבֵּיתָ} \textit{you have prophesied} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נבא}; Jer 26:9) as opposed to the expected form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִבֵּאתָ} (Jer 20:6; 28:6).
	
	\section{Temporal Subordinate Clauses}
	
	Temporal subordinate clauses locate in time a state of affair in relation to another state of affairs. The event can be either anterior, simultaneous or posterior to the other event. Frequently used temporal conjunctions are: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַחֲרֵי אֲשֶׁר} \textit{after}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּאֲשֶׁר} \textit{when, after}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בְּטֶרֶם} \textit{before}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַד} \textit{until, when}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עַד אֲשֶׁר} \textit{until}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} \textit{when}.
	
	The temporal subordinate clause either precedes the main clause (Josh 9:16) or it follows the main clause (2\,Sam 19:31).

	\section{Verbs I \textit{y}: Derived Binyanim}
	
	\subsection{Verbs I \textit{y}: Niphal, Hiphil and Hophal}
	
	Verbs of the type I\,\textit{y} are verbs with originally either /y/ or /w/ as first root consonant. In the Niphal, Hiphil and Hophal most I\,\textit{y} verbs behave like having /w/ as first root consonant. Only few exceptions to this are found in Biblical Hebrew. As the weakness of I\,\textit{y} verbs is in first position, the vowels of the prefix syllables in the Niphal, Hiphil and Hophal interact with the first root consonant in the following ways:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item In the suffix conjugation and participle Niphal: \textit{*nawšab > nōšaḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוֺשַׁב} in the suffix conjugation (from a primitive form \textit{*naqṭala}) and \textit{*nawšab > nōšāḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוֺשָׁב} in the participle
		\item In the Hiphil of most verbs: \textit{*hawšaba > hōšīḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוֺשִׁיב} (SC) (from a primitive form \textit{*haqṭala}), \textit{*yuhawšib > yōšīḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוֺשִׁיב} (PC) (the same applies to the other Hi.\ forms)
		\item In the Hiphil of a few verbs: \textit{*hayṭaba > hēṭīḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵיטִיב} (SC) (from a primitive form \textit{*haqṭala}), \textit{*yuhayṭib > yēṭīḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵיטִיב} (PC) (the same applies to the other Hi.\ forms)
		\item In the Hophal: \textit{*huwrad > hūrad} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּרַד} (SC), \textit{*yuwrad > yūrad} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוּרַד} (PC) (the same applies to the other Ho.\ forms)

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The primitive forms for the suffix conjugation \textit{*naqṭal} (Ni.) and \textit{*haqṭal} (Hi.) are different from the primitive forms for the corresponding forms of the strong verbs \textit{*niqṭal} and \textit{*hiqṭil}, respectively (cf. Chapters 16 and 17).
	
	In the Niphal prefix conjugation, imperative and infinitives the first root consonant is /w/ in most cases. The /n/ of the Niphal is assimilated to the /w/, e.g., \textit{yinwašiʿ > yiwwāšēăʿ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִוָּשֵׁ֑עַ} \textit{he will be saved} (pausal form; Prov 28:18). At times, the first root consonant /y/ is preserved, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִיָּרֶה} \textit{he shall be shot} (Exod 19:13).
	
	Five I\,\textit{y} verbs have Hiphil forms that are based on an original /y/ as R\textsubscript{1}: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יטב} Hi.\ \textit{to do good} (74×), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ילל} Hi.\ \textit{to howl} (30×), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ינק} Hi.\ \textit{to nurse, suckle} (9×), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ימן} Hi.\ \textit{to go to the right} (5×), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ישׁר} Hi.\ \textit{to make even} (2×).
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms the long vowel /ī/ as thematic vowel is replaced by /ē/ (except in pausal forms), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיּוֺשֵׁב} \textit{he settled} (transitive; Gen 47:11).
	
	In \textit{wayyiqṭol} verbs without suffix, stress is frequently retracted to the penultimate syllable with shortening of the thematic vowel /ē/ > /æ/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּ֫שֶׁב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֵּ֫יטֶב}. But forms without retraction of stress are attested, too, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיּוֺשֵׁב} (Gen 47:11). With a guttural as third root consonant the vowel /ē/ is shortened to /a/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּ֫שַׁע} \textit{and he saved} (Exod 14:30).
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הלך} follows the pattern of the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ישׁב}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירד}, etc., in the Hiphil forms. Illustrative Forms are the following:

	Frequent doubly weak verbs are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצא} Hi.\ \textit{to bring out, lead out}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ידה} Hi.\ \textit{to praise} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירא} Ni.\ \textit{to be feared, terrible, awesome}. The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ירא} Ni.\ is almost exclusively attested in the participle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוֺרָא}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוֺרָאָה} etc. The verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצא} Hi.\ and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ידה} Hi.\ have the following characteristic forms:
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יסף} \textit{to add} is used in the Qal only in the suffix conjugation (28×), the inf.\ cs.\ (only 1×) and the part.\ (only 1×). In the Hiphil it is used in all forms (except the inf.\ abs.; 171 times in total), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{‎הוֹסַפְתָּ} (SC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{‎יוֹסִיף} (PC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{‎וַיּ֫וֹסֶף} (\textit{wayyiqṭol}).
	
	Verbs of the type I\,\textit{y} with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} as second root consonant have forms with a geminated \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צ} in the Hi.\ and Ho., e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּצִּיגוּ} \textit{and they placed} (1\,Sam 5:2), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּצִּקֻם} \textit{and they poured them out} (with ePP; Josh 7:23), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תַּצִּיתוּ} \textit{you shall set on fire} (Josh 8:8). Although forms like these look like forms of I\,\textit{n} verbs, they are derived from the verbs \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצג}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצק} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יצת}, respectively.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ילד} has inf.\ cs.\ forms in the Hophal with a geminated second root consonant instead of a long vowel /ū/ in the prefix syllable: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֻלֶּדֶת} or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּלֶּדֶת} \textit{hullædæt} in the constructions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוֹם הֻלֶּדֶת} \textit{birthday} (Gen 40:20) or \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוֹם הוּלֶּדֶת} \textit{day of birth} (Ezek 16:4).
	
	\subsection{Verbs I \textit{y}: Piel, Pual and Hitpael}
	
	In the Piel, Pual and Hitpael I\,\textit{y} have strong forms in the entire paradigms. In the Piel and Pual the first root consonant /y/ is preserved. In the Hitpael of some verbs the first root consonant is changed to /w/ while in the majority of verbs the /y/ is preserved. Important forms are included in the following table (only attested forms are included).

	\section{Modifying verbs}
	
	Some verbs may be used together with another verb as modifying verbs. When used in this way, they function as adverbial modifiers, i.e., the modifying verb expresses only an adverbial idea whereas the other verb expresses the main verbal idea. Verbs that are frequently used as modifying verbs are: 
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.15\linewidth} p{0.25\linewidth} p{0.5\linewidth}}
		& Normal meaning & Meaning as modifying verb \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יסף} Q./Hi. & \textit{to add} & \textit{to do something again, continue doing something}; with a negative: \textit{to stop doing something; to not do something anymore} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁוב} Q. & \textit{to return} & \textit{to do something again} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מהר} Pi. & \textit{to hurry} & \textit{to do something quickly} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{רבה} Hi. & \textit{to multiply, increase} & \textit{to do something many times} \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁכם} Hi. & \textit{to rise early} & \textit{to do something early (in the morning)} \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	In many cases, the modifying verb precedes the modified verb which is in the infinitive construct, usually with the preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} (1\,Sam 7:13) but also without (Gen 8:12).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּכָּנְעוּ הַפְּלִשְׁתִּים וְלֹא־יָסְפוּ עוֹד לָבוֹא בִּגְבוּל יִשְׂרָאֵל} & \textit{And the Philistines were subdued and did not come into the territory of Israel again} (1\,Sam 7:13) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְלֹא־יָסְפָה שׁוּב־אֵלָיו עוֹד} & \textit{[The dove] did not return to him anymore} (Gen 8:12) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֹא־יוּכַל בַּעְלָהּ הָרִאשׁוֹן אֲשֶֽר־שִׁלְּחָהּ לָשׁוּב לְקַחְתָּהּ לִהְיוֹת לוֹ לְאִשָּׁה} & \textit{Her first husband, who sent her away, cannot take her back again to be his wife} (Deut 24:4) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר יִצְחָק אֶל־בְּנוֹ מַה־זֶּה מִהַרְתָּ לִמְצֹא בְּנִי} & \textit{And Isaac said to his son, \enquote{How did you find it so quickly, my son?}} (Gen 27:20) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּשְׁכֵּם מְשָׁרֵת אִישׁ הָאֱלֹהִים לָקוּם} & \textit{And the servant of the man of God got up early in the morning} (2\,Kgs 6:15) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	Instead of a verbal form and an infinitive construct two finite verbal forms may be joined together, either in a syndetic construction with the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} (2\,Sam 18:22; 1\,Sam 25:23) or in an asyndetic construction without \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} (Isa 52:1). The first verb is used as the modifying verb.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּסֶף עוֹד אֲחִימַעַץ בֶּן־צָדוֹק וַיֹּאמֶר אֶל־יוֹאָב ...} & \textit{And Ahimaaz son of Zadok said again to Joab} (2\,Sam 18:22) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֵּרֶא אֲבִיגַיִל אֶת־דָּוִד וַתְּמַהֵר וַתֵּרֶד מֵעַל הַחֲמוֹר} & \textit{And Abigail saw David and quickly got off the donkey} (1\,Sam 25:23) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{... כִּי לֹא יוֹסִיף יָבֹא־בָךְ עוֹד עָרֵל וְטָמֵא} & \textit{\dots \space for no uncircumcised or unclean will come into you anymore} (Isa 52:1) \\

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the Niphal, the open prefix syllable in the suffix conjugation and the participle needs to be noted. In the prefix conjugation the /n/ of the Ni.\ is assimilated to the first root consonant, e.g., \textit{*yinkōn > yikkōn} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִכּוֺן}.
	
	Hiphil forms are characterized by an open prefix syllable. If the prefix syllable immediately precedes the stressed syllable, it has a full vowel. Otherwise the vowel is reduced.
	
	In the suffix conjugation Hiphil and the participle, the vowel of the prefix syllable is /ē/ (\textit{ṣere}) (cf.\ the Hiphil form of the strong verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִכְתִּיב}). In the other forms, i.e., the prefix conjugation, the imperative, and the infinitives, it is /ā/ (\textit{qameṣ}) (cf. the Hiphil prefix conjugation form of the strong verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַכְתִּיב} etc.)
	
	Before consonantal suffixes a long, unchanging connecting vowel /ō/ is usually inserted between the second root consonant and the suffix which carries the stress, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲקִימֹ֫תִי} \textit{I have carried out} (1\,Sam 15:13). However, forms without connecting vowel are attested, too, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵנַ֫פְתָּ} (root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוף}) \textit{you have swung [your tool above it]} (Exod 20:25).
	
	In the prefix conjugation, 3/2 f.\ pl.\ forms without connecting vowel are attested, too, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תָּשֵׁ֫בְנָה} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁוב}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תָּקִ֫ימְנָה} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קום}).
	
	The doubly weak verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא} is frequently used in the Hiphil. As can be expected, the /ʾ/ is silent at the end of a syllable, but it functions as a consonant when a vowel follows. In the suffix conjugation Hiphil, the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בוא} has usually forms without connecting vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵבֵאתָ} \textit{you have brought}. But with enclitic personal pronouns forms with connecting vowel are used, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲבִיאֹתַ֫נִי} \textit{you have brought me} (2 Sam 7:18).
	
	In forms without suffix, II\,\textit{w/y} verbs have distinct jussive and \textit{wayyiqṭol} forms in the Hiphil, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָקֵם} \textit{may he set up} as opposed to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יָקִים} \textit{he will set up}. \textit{waw}-PC forms (\textit{wayyiqṭol}) show retraction of stress and shortening of the thematic vowel, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫קֶם} \textit{wayyā́qæm}; \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫שֶׁב} \textit{wayyā́šæḇ}.
	
	Long imperative forms of II\,\textit{w/y} verbs have the long vowel /ī/ between the first and second root consonant in the Hiphil, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָקִ֫ימָה} and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הָבִ֫יאָה}.
	
	In the Hiphil, all II\,\textit{w/y} verbs have the same thematic vowel irrespective of their thematic vowel in the Qal.

	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוח} Q.\ \textit{to rest} has two distinct sets of Hiphil forms with different meanings. Hiphil~A follows the pattern of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קום} in the Hiphil. In  Hiphil B the first root consonant is geminated. The meaning of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוח} in Hiphil A is \textit{to cause to rest, to give rest}. In Hiphil B the meaning is \textit{to lay, set down; to leave, let remain}. The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נוח} occurs in Hiphil A about 34 times and in Hiphil B about 69 times.

	In forms of the \textit{waw}-PC and the imperative without suffixes the vowel between the two root consonants is /a/ (\textit{pataḥ}) because of the guttural /ḥ/ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ח}. The Hiphil A \textit{waw}-PC form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיָּ֫נַח} is identical to the corresponding Qal form; the context helps to distinguish the two forms.
	
	The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בושׁ} Q.\ \textit{to be ashamed} has two distinct Hiphil forms with different meanings. There are forms that follow the other II\,\textit{w/y} verbs such as \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קום}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֱבִישׁוֺתָ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תָּבִ֫ישׁוּ}. These forms have the meaning \textit{to put to shame}. The variant forms follow the I\,\textit{y} verbs, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוֺבִישׁ}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֹבִישׁוּ}. These forms have the meaning \textit{to be put to shame, be ashamed}.
	
	Hophal forms of II\,\textit{w/y} verbs follow the pattern of I\,\textit{y} verbs. Originally the Hophal forms had a short vowel in the prefix syllable, e.g., \textit{*huqam}. As the short vowel /u/ in the open syllable had to be reduced, the characteristic vowel of the passive would have been lost. The short vowel was therefore lengthened \textit{*huqam > hūqam} by analogy with the I\,\textit{y} verbs.
	
	Hophal forms with a vocalic suffix like \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֻמְתוּ} \textit{they were killed} (2\,Sam 21:9) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּבְאוּ} \textit{they were brought in} (Gen 43:18) are the only forms of II\,\textit{w/y} verbs without a vowel between the first and the second root consonant in Masoretic Hebrew.
	
	
	\subsection{Verbs II \textit{w/y}: Polel, Polal and Hitpolel}
	
	With very few (and late) exceptions, II\,\textit{w/y} verbs are not used in the Piel, Pual or Hitpael, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְקַיֵּם} \textit{to confirm} (Esth 9:29). Instead, they are used in the Polel, Polal and Hitpolel. These binyanim are characterized by a long unchangeable vowel /ō/ after the first root consonant and reduplication of the second root consonant. As a result, forms of these binyanim are easy to identify. The vowel /ō/ after the first root consonant is often spelled plene but may be spelled defectively, too. The meaning of the Polel, Polal and Hitpolel corresponds with the Piel, Pual and Hitpael, respectively. In Biblical Hebrew, there are 172 instances of Polel forms, 13 Polal forms and 70 Hitpolel forms.
	
	The following table contains characteristic forms. For Polal the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כון} Po.\ \textit{to set up, establish} is used and for the Hitpolel the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בין} Hitpo.\ \textit{to behave intelligently}, because these verbs are relatively frequent. Forms of other verbs supplement the two verbs, when important forms are missing.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The immediate context helps to distinguish between ambiguous forms of the Polel (active) and Polal (passive).
	
	Participles have a /m/ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְ} as prefix consonant.
	
	In the Polel and Hitpolel, the vowel /e/ after the second root consonant is changed to /a/ in suffix conjugation forms with consonantal sufffix due to Philippi's Law.
	
	In the Hitpolel, pausal forms have the vowel /ā/ between the reduplicated root consonant.

	\section{Verbs II Geminate: Derived Binyanim}
	
	\subsection{Verbs II Geminate: Niphal, Hiphil and Hophal}
	
	The Niphal forms are characterized by an open prefix syllable in the suffix conjugation and the participle. In the prefix conjugation, the imperative and infinitives the /n/ is assimilated to the first root consonant, e.g., \textit{yinsab > yissaḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִסַּב}.
	
	In the Hiphil, many forms are characterized by open prefix syllables. In prefix conjugation forms, the prefix syllable may be open. In this case, the second root consonant is geminated when when suffixes are attached. But the first root consonant may be doubled in prefix conjugation forms, as well (so-called aramaizing forms).
	
	Hophal forms follow the pattern of I\,\textit{y} verbs in order to preserve the original short vowel /u/ in the prefix syllable: \textit{*husab > hūsaḇ} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּסַב}.
	
	As in the Qal, vocalic suffixes are not stressed. A connecting vowel is inserted between the geminated second root consonant and a consonantal suffix. The connecting vowel bears the stress.
	
	When suffixes are added, the gemination of the second root consonant is preserved.
	
	
	\vspace{0.25cm}
	
	\noindent The table only contains selected forms because of the relative infrequency of II~gem.\ verbs in the derived binyanim.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent In the suffix conjugation Niphal, the thematic vowel between the first and second root consonant may be /ō/ or /ē/ instead of /a/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְנָבֹ֫זּוּ} \textit{and they will be plundered}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָמֵס} \textit{it is melted} (but as a pausal form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָמָ֑ס}).
	
	The I gutt.\ and II gem.\ verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חתת} has Niphal prefix conjugation forms with a lengthened prefix vowel as result of the loss of the gemination, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֵחַת} (\textit{*yinḥat > *yiḥḥat > yēḥat}). In the suffix conjugation, the 3 m.\ sg.\ form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נִחַת} is attested once.
	
	In the Hiphil the thematic vowel of the 3 f.\ sg.\ and 3 c.\ pl.\ forms may be either /a/ or /ē/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵסַ֫בּוּ} \textit{they brought round} (1\,Sam 5:9--10), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵחֵ֫לָּה} \textit{she/it began} (Judg 20:40), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵחֵּ֫לּוּ} \textit{they began} (1\,Sam 3:2).
	
	With a guttural or /r/ as second root consonant the thematic vowel may be lengthened when suffixes are added, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַהֲצֵרוֹתִי} \textit{and I will cause distress} (Jer 10:18), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֲרֵעֹתֶם} \textit{you have done something bad} (Gen 43:6).
	
	% The form \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִשַּׁחוּ} in Qoh 12:4 is not included because of the uncertainties around it (Qal aramaizing form?)
	
	Forms without a connecting vowel between the second root consonant and the consonantal suffix are also found, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהֵפַרְתָּ֫ה} \textit{and you shall make ineffectual} (2\,Sam 15:34). In this form the gemination of the second root consonant is lost.
	
	Aramaizing forms with a geminated first root occur a number of times, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּסֵּב} \textit{and he caused to go around} (Josh 6:11), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיַּסֵּבּוּ} \textit{and they brought} (1\,Sam 5:8), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַתֵּם} \textit{let him count out the entire amount} (2\,Kgs 22:4), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַחֵל} (with loss of the gemination of the /ḥ/ and preservation of the short vowel) \textit{let him [not] make invalid} (Num 30:3).
	
	In rare cases, the gemination of the second root consonant is missing, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְנָבְקָה} \textit{and it shall be disturbed} (3 fem.\ sg.\ \textit{waw}-SC Ni.\ from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בקק}; Jes 19:3), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֵעֵ֫זָה} \textit{she made [her face] bold} (3 fem.\ sg.\ SC Hi.\ from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עזז}; Prov 7:13).
	
	Contamination with forms of II\,\textit{w/y} verbs may happen occasionally, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִבּוֹז תִּבּוֹז} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עזז} Ni.) \textit{[the earth] will be plundered} (Isa 24:3), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יַשִּׁים} (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁמם} Hi.) \textit{he will devastate} (Jer 49:20). Other deviating forms are attested as well.
	
	
	\subsection{Verbs II Geminate: Polel, Polal and Hitpolel}
	
	Verbs II gem.\ are used in the Piel, Pual and Hitpael relatively frequently. Like II\,\textit{w/y} verbs, they are used in the Polel, Polal and Hitpolel, binyanim, which are characterized by a long unchangeable vowel /ō/ after the first root consonant and reduplication of the second root consonant. These binyanim correspond with the Piel, Pual and Hitpael in terms of their meaning.
	
	The following table contains characteristic forms. The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עלל} Polel \textit{to act arbitrarily (toward)} is used, because it occurs in all three binyanim Polel, Polal and Hitpolel. Forms of other verbs supplement this verb, when important forms are missing.

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The immediate context helps to distinguish between ambiguous forms of the Polel (active) and Polal (passive).
	
	Participles have a /m/ \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְ} as prefix consonant.
	
	In pausal forms of the Hitpolel /ā/ is found instead of /ē/, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תִּתְגּוֹדָֽדִי} \textit{you cut yourself} (Jer 47:5). % RSV/ESV gash for cut
	
	\section{The Marker of Subordination  \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁ ּ}}
	
	The marker of subordination \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁ ּ} is placed in front of the following word with a \textit{dageš forte} in the first consonant of this word. At times, one finds \textit{pataḥ} instead of \textit{segol}, i.e., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שַׁ ּ}. Before /r/ and /ʾ/ the vowel is changed to /ā/ and the \textit{dageš forte} is lost leading to \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שָׁ}
	
	The particle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁ ּ} functions similarly to the much more frequent \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר}. Important functions are:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] marking relative clauses, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּחוֹל שֶׁעַל־שְׂפַת הַיָּם} \textit{as the sand which is upon the shore of the sea} (Judg 7:12; cf. \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכַחוֹל אֲשֶׁר עַל־שְׂפַת הַיָּם} in Gen 22:17)
		\item[--] as an alternative construction for a construct chain or an enclitic personal pronoun, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּרְמִי שֶׁלִּי} \textit{my vineyard} (Song 1:6)
		\item[--] introducing an object clause, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְעָשִׂיתָ לִּי אוֹת שָׁאַתָּה מְדַבֵּר עִמִּי} \textit{and give me a sign that it is you who speak with me} (Judg 6:17); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְיָדַעְתִּי גַם־אָנִי שֶׁמִּקְרֶה אֶחָד יִקְרֶה אֶת־כֻּלָּם} \textit{Yet I know that one fate will befall them all} (Qoh 2:14)
		\item[--] introducing a causal subordinate clause, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פִּתְחִי־לִי אֲחֹתִי רַעְיָתִי יוֹנָתִי תַמָּתִי שֶׁרֹּאשִׁי נִמְלָא־טָל} \textit{Open to me, my sister, my beloved, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is filled with dew} (Song 5:2)
		\item[--] introducing a final subordinate clause, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְהָאֱלֹהִים עָשָׂה שֶׁיִּרְאוּ מִלְּפָנָיו} \textit{and God has done this so that one would fear him} (Qoh 3:14)
		\item[--] with prepositions in various functions
	\end{itemize} 
	
	The subordination marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁ ּ} occurs 138 times in the Hebrew Bible and is mainly used in Late Biblical Hebrew or in a few earlier texts of northern origin. It is especially frequent in Song of Songs and Qohelet.
	
	\section{Asyndetic Relative Clauses}
	
	Relative clauses are usually introduced with the subordination marker \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} or much less frequently \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֶׁ ּ}. They are then called \emph{syndetic} relative clauses. It is possible, however, to attach a relative clause directly to the antecedent without a subordination marker. Both verbal clauses (Jer 13:20; Deut 32:17; Exod 18:20; Jer 5:15) and verbless clauses (Isa 51:7) may function as \emph{asyndetic} relative clauses.

	\section{The Verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חוה} Hištaphel}
	
	The III\,\textit{y} verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חוה} \textit{to bow down, prostrate; to worship} occurs about 170 times in the Hebrew Bible. It is only used in the Hištaphel (or more precisely Hištap̄ʿel), a binyan that is characterized by a causative prefix consonant /š/, the consonant /t/ which marks reflexivity and, in the suffix conjugation, the imperative and the infinitive construct, a prosthetic /h/. At the same time, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חוה} is the only verb used in the Hištaphel.
	
	The following forms can be mentioned as examples:

	\noindent \textbf{Notes}
	\nopagebreak
	
	\noindent The verb shows the morphological features of III\,\textit{y} verbs.
	
	In the \textit{wayyiqṭol}-form without suffixes (3 m./f.\ sg.) the apocopate forms have a long vowel /ū/ at the end: \textit{*wayyištaḥw > wayyištaḥuw > wayyištáḥū} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּשְׁתַּ֫חוּ}. In pausal forms the \textit{pataḥ} is lengthened to \textit{qameṣ}, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתִּשְׁתָּ֫חוּ}.
	
	Traditionally, these forms were considered Hitpaʿlel forms of a verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁחה} with metathesis of the /t/ and the /š/ and reduplication of the third element of the root, first as a semivowel /w/ and then as a vocalic element as usual with III\,\textit{y} verbs.\footnote{\space Cf.\ GKC §\,75\,\textit{kk}; BDB 1005a.}
	
	Since the Ugaritic language, a Central Semitic language from the period of 1400--1200 BCE that is similar to Hebrew, was deciphered in 1930, most scholars analyze these forms as Hištap̄ʿel of a root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חוה}, because in Ugaritic a Hištap̄ʿel binyan including forms of a verb \textit{ḥwy} with similar forms and identical meaning as the Hebrew verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{חוה} is clearly attested, e.g., \textit{tštḥwy} \textit{she prostrates herself}.
	
	
	\section{The Qal Passive}
	
	Some verbal forms appear to be Pual or Hophal forms. It can be shown, however, that these forms are remnants of a Qal passive binyan which is the passive counterpart to the Qal in the same way as the Hophal and the Pual are the passive counterparts to the Hiphil and the Piel. The Qal passive was being phased out during the period of Biblical Hebrew but the existing forms in the biblical texts were preserved. The following
	arguments for the existence of the Qal passive can be mentioned:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item These alleged Pual or Hophal forms do not have active counterparts in the Piel or	Hiphil, respectively.
		\item These forms have a meaning that serves as the passive to the meaning of the verbs in question in the Qal.
		\item The verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח} has suffix conjugation forms that are vocalized as Pual and prefix conjugation forms that look like Hophal forms, e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֻקַּח} (3 m.\ sg.\ SC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֻקַּח} (3 m.\ sg.\ PC; with assimilation of the /l/). Yet, the meaning of the verb is identical, namely passive to Qal forms: \textit{to be taken}. This situation would be unusual for how the binyanim function in Biblical Hebrew without the assumption of a Qal passive.
		\item Classical Arabic has passive forms in Stem I, the equivalent of the Qal binyan in Hebrew, e.g., \textit{fuʿila} \textit{it was done} as opposed to the active form \textit{faʿala} \textit{he did}. Internal passive forms are also attested in Old Aramaic and Biblical Aramaic.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Qal passive forms are characterized by the vowel sequence \textit{u–a} which is characteristic of passive forms. The following examples
	are illustrative:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] suffix conjugation: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֻקַּח} (3 m.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כֹּרָ֑תָה}, \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֻקֳחָה} (3 f.\ sg.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֻלְּדוּ} (3 c.\ pl.)
		\item[--] prefix conjugation: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֻקּ͏ַח} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יֻתּ͏ַן} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יוּ͏שׁ͏ַת} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁית}), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתּ͏ֻקּ͏ַח} (verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח}; 3 f.\ sg.\ \textit{waw}-PC)
		\item[--] participle: \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֻכּ͏ָל} (m.\ sg.; Exod 3:2); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לֻקָּח} (2\,Kgs 2:10)
	\end{itemize}
	
	These forms show the characteristics of weak verbs like the assimilation of /n/ or /l/ as in the case of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח}. The following illustrate the use of the Qal passive:
	
	\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְשַׁלְּחֵהוּ יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים מִגַּן־עֵדֶן לַעֲבֹד אֶת־הָאֲדָמָה אֲשֶׁר לֻקַּח מִשָּׁם} & \textit{And the Lord God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken} (Gen 3:23) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְזֹאת יִקָּרֵא אִשָּׁה כִּי מֵאִישׁ לֻקֳחָה־זֹּאת} & \textit{This one shall be called woman because from man she has been taken} (Gen 2:23b) \\
		\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתֻּקַּח הָאִשָּׁה בֵּית פַּרְעֹה} & \textit{And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house} (Gen 12:15) \\
	\end{longtable}
	
	Qal passive forms were already recognized as such by Jewish grammarians during the Middle Ages. In the middle of the 19th century they were rediscovered as Qal passive forms by western scholars and not considered Pual of Hophal forms anymore. Modern lexica recognize Qal passive forms to different degrees. For the identification of Qal passive forms it is recommended to consult \textit{HALOT} or Wilhelm Gesenius, \textit{Hebräisches und aramäisches Handwörterbuch über das Alte Testament}, ed. H. Donner, 18th ed. (Berlin: Springer, 2013). BDB does \emph{not} recognize the Qal passive and therefore should not be consulted for this matter. Electronic versions of the Hebrew Bible with morphological tags recognize only a part of all (possible) Qal passive forms. According to the Westminster Hebrew Morphology tagging, the Qal passive is attested 87 times in the Hebrew Bible. The most frequent verbs in the Qal passive are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ילד} (27 times), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לקח} (15 times) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נתן} (8 times).\footnote{\space Hebrew Masoretic Text with Westminster Hebrew Morphology (HMT-W4), Groves-Wheeler Westminster Hebrew Morphology, v.\ 4.22, version 3.1 in Accordance 14.0.11.}

	\section{Rare Binyanim}
	
	The following rare binyanim in Biblical Hebrew need to be mentioned:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item[--] Poʿel (with the passive Poʿal and the reflexive Hitpoʿel), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שֹׁרֵשׁ} \textit{it took root} (Isa 40:24)
		\item[--] Paʿlel (with the passive Puʿlal), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שַׁאֲנָן} \textit{he was at ease} (root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{שׁאן}; Jer 48:11), passive \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֻמְלַל} \textit{it became feeble} (root \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אמל}; Joel 1:10)
		\item[--] Pilpel (with the passive Polpal and the reflexive Hitpalpel), e.g., \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּלְכַּל} \textit{he sustained} (with /a/ in the second syllable; 2\,Sam 19:33); \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכָלְכְּלוּ} \textit{wəḵɔlkəlū} \textit{and they were supplied with food} (1\,Kgs 20:27)
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	The forms of these binyanim are not easily recognizable as verbal forms, unless they have the familiar verbal suffixes or prefixes. The lexicon will help to identify these forms as verbal forms.
	
	Pilpel forms occur 50 times in the Hebrew Bible. No less than 24 of these occurrences are from the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כול} Pilpel \textit{to sustain} (with food). Pilpel forms are easy to identify because of the reduplication of the two root consonants. The vowel structure of Pilpel forms is identical to Piel forms. The difference with Piel forms is that Pilpel forms have two different consonants where Piel forms have the geminated second root consonant. In the same way, the vowel structure of Polpal and Hitpalpel forms is identical to Hitpael and Pual forms, respectively. Pilpel forms are mainly derived from II gem.\ verbs and less frequently from II\,\textit{w/y} verbs, if roots are counted and not occurrences of Pilpel forms.\footnote{\space Alternatively, Pilpel forms can be derived from biconsonantal roots with reduplication of both root consonants. BDB and \textit{HALOT} do this only for the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{טאטא}.}
	
	% The 18\textsuperscript{th} edition of Gesenius' Handwörterbuch (in German) does this relatively often.}

Characteristic Pilpel forms of the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כול} are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּלְכַּל} (SC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יְכַלְכֵּל} (PC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְכַלְכֵּל} (\textit{waw}-PC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְכִלְכַּלְתִּי} (\textit{waw}-SC), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כַּלְכֵּל} (inf.\ cs.), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְכַלְכֵּל}.

In terms of vowel structure, Pilpel forms are identical to the forms of quadriliteral verbs with four root consonants. In the Hebrew Bible only very few forms of quadriliteral verbs attested. One verb that is worth mentioning is the verb \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תרגם}. In the Hebrew Bible, it is attested only once as a participle Polpal \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מְתֻרְגָּם} \textit{translated} (Ezra 4:7). It is the normal word for \textit{to translate} from post-biblical Hebrew to Modern Israeli Hebrew (cf.\ the noun \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{תַּרְגוּם} \textit{translation; Targum}).

\section{Final and Consecutive Constructions}

Final and consecutive constructions indicate the purpose or the consequence or result of a state of affairs, respectively. They can be expressed by subordinate clauses, the use of indirect volitive forms and prepositions.

A frequently used conjunction introducing final subordinate clauses is (\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר}) \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְמַעַן} (Deut 8:1; Josh 3:4). Less frequent are the conjunctions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּעֲבוּר} (Exod 19:9) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} (Deut 4:40). For negative final subordinate clauses the conjunction \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{פֶּן} is used (Exod 20:19).

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כָּל־הַמִּצְוָה אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם תִּשְׁמְרוּן לַעֲשׂוֹת לְמַעַן תִּחְיוּן וּרְבִיתֶם וּבָאתֶם וִירִשְׁתֶּם אֶת־הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּע יְהוָה לַאֲבֹתֵיכֶם׃} & \textit{You shall carefully keep all the instruction that I command you today, in order that you will live and become numerous and go in and take possession of the land that the Lord swore to your fathers} (Deut 8:1) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אַל־תִּקְרְבוּ אֵלָיו לְמַעַן אֲשֶׁר־תֵּדְעוּ אֶת־הַדֶּרֶךְ אֲשֶׁר תֵּלְכוּ־בָהּ} & \textit{Do not come close to [the ark], in order that you know the way which you shall go} (Josh 3:4) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי בָּא אֵלֶיךָ בְּעַב הֶעָנָן בַּעֲבוּר יִשְׁמַע הָעָם בְּדַבְּרִי עִמָּךְ} & \textit{The Lord said to Moses, \enquote{Behold, I am coming to you in the thick cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you}} (Exod 19:9) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְשָׁמַרְתָּ אֶת־חֻקָּיו וְאֶת־מִצְוֹתָיו אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם אֲשֶׁר יִיטַב לְךָ וּלְבָנֶיךָ אַחֲרֶיךָ} & \textit{\dots \space and you shall keep his statutes and his commandments that I command you today, in order that it may be well with you and you children after you} (Deut 4:40) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְאַל־יְדַבֵּר עִמָּנוּ אֱלֹהִים פֶּן־נָמוּת} & \textit{\dots \space but do not let God speak with with us, lest we die} (Exod 20:19) \\
\end{longtable}

Consecutive subordinate clauses are mostly introduced with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} (Exod 3:11) and only rarely with the conjunctions \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְמַעַן} (Jer 27:15) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{אֲשֶׁר} (Gen 13:16).

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{‎מִי אָנֹכִי כִּי אֵלֵךְ אֶל־פַּרְעֹה וְכִי אוֹצִיא אֶת־בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מִמִּצְרָיִם} & \textit{Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should lead the Israelites out of Egypt} (Exod 3:11) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי לֹא שְׁלַחְתִּים נְאֻם־יְהוָה וְהֵם נִבְּאִים בִּשְׁמִי לַשָּׁקֶר לְמַעַן הַדִּיחִי אֶתְכֶם} & \textit{For I have not sent them, and yet they prophesy in my name falsely, with the result that I will drive you out} (Jer 27:15) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְשַׂמְתִּי אֶת־זַרְעֲךָ כַּעֲפַר הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר אִם־יוּכַל אִישׁ לִמְנוֹת אֶת־עֲפַר הָאָרֶץ גַּם־זַרְעֲךָ יִמָּנֶה} & \textit{And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth, so that if someone can count the dust of the earth, your descendants too can be counted} (Gen 13:16) \\
\end{longtable}

Two clauses that are coordinated with \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְ} with an indirect volitive mood in the second the clause are also frequently used to express a final or consecutive relation. In the second clause, a cohortative (Gen 27:4), an imperative (2\,Sam 21:3) or a third person jussive form (Judg 6:30) may be used.

% The first two examples are from Lettinga/von Siebenthal, §78 (715)

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַעֲשֵׂה־לִי מַטְעַמִּים כַּאֲשֶׁר אָהַבְתִּי וְהָבִיאָה לִּי וְאֹכֵלָה} & \textit{\dots \space and make for me tasty food as I like [it] and bring it to me so that I may eat [it]} (Gen 27:4) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{מָה אֶעֱשֶׂה לָכֶם וּבַמָּה אֲכַפֵּר וּבָרְכוּ אֶת־נַחֲלַת יְהוָה} & \textit{What shall I do for you and with what shall I make atonement so that you may bless the heritage of the Lord} (2\,Sam 21:3) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוֹצֵא אֶת־בִּנְךָ וְיָמֹת} & \textit{Bring out your son that he may die} (Judg 6:30) \\
\end{longtable}

As prepositions with final meaning can be mentioned \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} (Exod 16:15) and -- followed by the inf.\ cs.\ -- \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְמַעַן} (1\,Sam 17:28), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַּעֲבוּר} (Exod 20:20) and with negative meaning \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְבִלְתִּי} (1\,Kgs 15:17).

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הוּא הַלֶּחֶם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן יְהוָה לָכֶם לְאָכְלָה} & \textit{That is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat} (i.e., with the intention that you may eat it; Exod 16:15) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי לְמַעַן רְאוֹת הַמִּלְחָמָה יָרָֽדְתָּ} & \textit{\dots \space for you came down to see the battle} (1\,Sam 17:28) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיֹּאמֶר מֹשֶׁה אֶל־הָעָם אַל־תִּירָאוּ כִּי לְבַעֲבוּר נַסּוֹת אֶתְכֶם בָּא הָאֱלֹהִים} & \textit{And Moses said to the people, \enquote{Do not be afraid, for God has come to test you}} (Exod 20:20) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיִּבֶן אֶת־הָרָמָה לְבִלְתִּי תֵּת יֹצֵא וָבָא לְאָסָא מֶלֶךְ יְהוּדָה} & \textit{And he fortified Ramah in order to not allow anyone belonging to Asa king of Judah to go out [for battle] or go in} (1\,Kgs 15:17) \\
\end{longtable}

The preposition \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{לְ} is also used with consecutive meaning (Ps 78:25).

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{צֵידָה שָׁלַח לָהֶם לָשֹׂבַע} & \textit{\dots \space he sent them provisions with satiety as result} (Ps 78:25) \\
\end{tabular}


\section{Concessive Subordinate Clauses}

% The definition of concessive is a paraphrase of Hadumod Bussmann, Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics (London: Routledge, 1996), 93.

A concessive subordinate clause expresses a condition that even if it is fulfilled, does not lead to the result that is expressed in the main clause. In English, the conjunction \textit{although} among others introduces concessive subordinate clauses. In Biblical Hebrew, the most frequent concessive conjunctions are \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כִּי} (Exod 13:17), \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גַּם כִּי} (Ps 23:4a) and \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גַּם} (Jer 36:25).

% The conjunction אם (Lettinga/von Siebenthal, Ges18, HALOT) (e.g., Num 22:18; Job 9:15; the best example is possibly Job 9:20) brings this too close to hypothetical conditional clauses. For this reason it was not included here.
% The conjunctions על and על אשר with concessive meaning (Lettinga/von Siebenthal, Ges18, BDB) is too infrequent to be included; Ges18 and BDB mention only Isa 53:9; Job 16:17.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}p{0.35\linewidth} p{0.55\linewidth}}
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַיְהִי בְּשַׁלַּח פַּרְעֹה אֶת־הָעָם וְלֹא־נָחָם אֱלֹהִים דֶּרֶךְ אֶרֶץ פְּלִשְׁתִּים כִּי קָרוֹב הוּא} & \textit{When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although it was near} (Exod 13:17) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{גַּם כִּי־אֵלֵךְ בְּגֵיא צַלְמָוֶת לֹא־אִירָא רָע} & \textit{Even though I walk in the valley of deep darkness, I do not fear evil} (Ps 23:4) \\
	\foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וְגַם אֶלְנָתָן וּדְלָיָהוּ וּגְמַרְיָהוּ הִפְגִּעוּ בַמֶּלֶךְ לְבִלְתִּי שְׂרֹף אֶת־הַמְּגִלָּה וְלֹא שָׁמַע אֲלֵיהֶם} & \textit{Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he did not listen to them} (Jer 36:25) \\

\chapter{Ketiv and Qere in the Hebrew Bible}

% As this is a textual phenomenon and not a grammatical one, Ketiv and Qere is explained in an appendix.

The text of the Hebrew Bible was finalized at the end of the 1st century and the early 2nd century CE. Since the 2nd century CE, the then still unpointed text remained stable; changes were not allowed. As a consequence, a system was developed by the Masoretes that allowed for alternative readings.

For this purpose, the alternative reading was put in the margin of the biblical text in the manuscript. This is called \textit{Qere} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קְרֵי}, Aramaic for \textit{(what is to be) read}. A small \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ק̇} with a dot on top (an abbreviation for \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קְרֵי}) under the alternative reading indicates it.

The reading for which there is a variant is indicated by a small circle (in Latin \textit{circellus}) that was placed on top of the Hebrew word or words. This word or these words are called \textit{Ketiv} \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתִיב} \textit{(what is) written}. 

The vowel signs of the Qere and the accents are placed with the Ketiv in the main text and not with the Qere in the margin. When the vowels are incompatible with the word they are placed with (as in 2\,Kgs 18:27 for example), it is an indication that there is a Qere in the margin. Otherwise, one always needs to look for a Qere in the margin in order not to miss it.

It needs to be noted that the Qere practically replaces the Ketiv so that only the Qere is read and not the Ketiv, although the Ketiv may be interesting in itself.

Qere may be found in the following circumstances in the Hebrew Bible:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item[--] Correction of obvious mistakes, e.g., Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עברנו} \textit{our crossing} with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{עָבְרָם} \textit{their crossing} (Josh 5:1)
	\item[--] Adjustment to spelling conventions, e.g., Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ותלוש} \textit{and she kneaded} with an exceptional vowel letter \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{ו} for a short vowel with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{וַתָּ֫לָשׁ} \textit{wattā́lɔš} \textit{and she kneaded} (2\,Sam 13:8)
	\item[--] Adjustments to grammatical norms, e.g., Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בהשדה} with unusual preservation of the article after a proclitic preposition with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{בַשָּׂדֶה} \textit{in the field} (2\,Kgs 7:12)
	\item[--] Preferred readings, e.g., Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הבאיש} (vocalized \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִבְאִישׁ}) \textit{he became hated} with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הֹבִישׁ} \textit{he became ashamed} (Isa 30:5)
\end{itemize}

A Qere may be even found where is there no word in the main text that it is meant to replace. This is a case of \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קרי ולא כתיב},\footnote{\space In vocalized Aramaic \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{קְרֵי וְלָא כְתִיב}.} e.g., Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הנה ימים} \textit{and see, days} with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{הִנֵּה יָמִים בָּאִים} \textit{and see, days are coming}. 
The opposite, an element in the main text that is not to be read, thus dropped, is called \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כתיב ולא קרי},\footnote{\space In vocalized Aramaic \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{כְּתִיב וְלָא קְרֵי}.} e.g., Ketiv \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יסלח נא} \textit{may he forgive} with the particle \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{נָא} with the Qere \foreignlanguage{hebrew}{יִסְלַח} (2\,Kgs 5:18).

% The following code for using a longtable in a multicol environent is based on the answer in this post: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/45980/balancing-long-table-inside-multicol-in-latex
% It is a workaround for the problem that longtable and multicol are not compatible because longtable can only be used in one-column environment.
% This workaround requires manual pagebreaks.
